Textual tinkerability maps storytelling gestures to changes in animation and text to assist reading exploration and demonstration of the link between text, spoken word, and concept. TinkRBooks are flexible tablet-based storybooks that allow readers to actively explore concepts in text using textual tinkerability. When reading TinkRBooks, both parents and children can alter text (character attributes and parts of speech) by manipulating story elements (props and characters) as they read. We demonstrate how textual tinkerability encourages more dialog, print referencing and dialogic questioning between parent-child dyads in shared reading as compared to paper books. In addition, our study reports observations of storytelling performance behaviors that foster playful and socially intimate shared reading behaviors that are closely mapped to the teaching and learning of emergent literacy skills.","1.

We felt that it was important to include the time comparison in Figure 16 to demonstrate that people spent more time with TinkRBook, enabling them to spend more time interacting with the reading material. This in turn, encourages more active exploration behaviors and discussions between parents and their children.  \  \ Our study attempted to detail the ""case"" of how parents read to their children, and shed new light on this activity by reporting performative reading behaviors. Our case study describes an intensive analysis of interactions that exist in the best-case parent-child reading scenarios during emergent literacy. These specific interaction behaviors led to the design of the technology as a storytelling prompt (to encourage the positive emergent literacy behaviors). In particular, these performative reading behaviors suggest that young children (in the best scenarios) learn how to read because they associate reading with intimate social bonding with their parents.  \  \ A more ""case-studies"" like focus on how end-users behave and use the technology has been achieved through the following changes: \ 1) Figure 15 detailing numerous observed shared reading interactions between parents and children when using the technology is emphasized in the text. This figure is emphasized in comparison to all the other quantitative findings to focus on the breadth of interactions that exist in parent-child reading. \ 2) Figures detailing the parent-child reading interactions are more prominently placed. \ 3) The observations of performative reading behaviors (with and without our technology) are reported in depth. \  \ Again, thank you to all the reviewers for your critique.","","","","","","Oct 11 12:30"

How were initial problems with Acrobat identified, we could do with some method here to make this clear to the reader. \  \ In the Beginning section, more specifically we listed the 9 areas of design enhancements during our design planning phase. Per review comment, we removed the term “matrix” since it can be confusing. We iterated this was simply a prioritization and negotiation exercise with PM. (page 2). \  \ 2. How were the guiding design principles formulated? What led you to pick them? \  \ The rationale of the two guiding design principles was added on page 4. \  \ 3. What research did you do that showed that your work had been well received by users (in the task panes section of the paper)? \  \ In the Task Panes section we now describe how we evaluated the designs to see that they were being well received (page 8) \  \ 4. You talk about using user metrics in passing but you have such an enormous base to gather thins information from I think it would be fascinating to hear more about this. \  \ In the Task Panes section on page 8, we now describe the behavior metrics which Adobe collects. We added the official program name and provided a link to more information about how this works (in the footnote and Citations section).  \  \ 5. In user testing I would welcome some more detail about exactly how many people you were working with an each point in the process. \  \ On page 10 in the ""Research Consisted Primarily of Iterative Test-and-Refine Studies"" section, detail is now provided about the sample size in the usability testing iterations. \  \ 6. When you talk about Matrixís for use with the product management team I wasn’t really clear what you meant, I think you need to be a bit more careful with defining your terms.  In a similar vein, I wasn’t entirely clear on the roles and responsibilities of the PM team, obviously I can take a guess but I think this caries a bit from company to company so perhaps you could make this more explicit as well. \  \ The definition of Product Management (PM) was added to the paper as footnote (page 2). \  \ Other revisions: \  \ 7. All figures are now within the textual content. A figure showing the difference between Acrobat 9 & X was added so it’s easier for readers to get a brief idea (page 3). \  \ 8. On page 13, more details were added to the “Group Usability Testing” section. \  \ 9. Changed the section title from “Key Takeaways & Conclusion” to “Lessons Learned” and provided more thoughts about what we learned and how we would do it differently next time. \  \ 10.

This study shows that the most intense collaboration takes place in early phases of the development activity such as concept generation and creation of design alternatives. This study also shows that there are differences in terms of methods, techniques and design languages in approaching the design problem, understanding users between industrial designers and interaction designers. Therefore conducting more case studies regarding this result might contribute to develop thriving techniques, design and representation languages.","[1]	Anderson, G.

Because they were in the workplace, they had real-time physical meetings.  \  \ R3: I also wonder what situations interactions between industrial and interaction designers do not occur. \  \ Previous field research which was done for the same PhD with leading design consultancies shows that there are different types of collaboration between industrial designers and interaction designers.  The first one is the type of collaboration which industrial designers begin to work with interaction designers after essential design decisions are taken. This type of collaboration seems to be quite common in industry although interviewees of the previous field research emphasized that there are serious disadvantages in terms of a product’s success and innovation. The first type of collaboration is out of this paper’s scope. The second one is the type of collaboration which industrial designers and interaction designers work closely together from the very beginning of product development activities.  \  \ R3: What could the HCI community really learn from the example described here? If the sole contribution is ‘it is essential for interaction designers and industrial designers to be in cooperation and collaboration’ then I believe we need to know more about HOW this might happen. However, I would also suggest that this is not a novel insight anyway – as these types of interactions are common in practice.  \  \ Because the boundaries are becoming increasingly blurry especially in early design processes which are also called as fuzzy front end, it is important to find out what roles interaction designers have when compared with the roles of industrial designers in product development activities; it is also important to find out  what roles these two professions share. \  \ R3: I realise that the case study focuses on an industrial practice – but I think it would be very worthwhile reflecting on how this relates to broader activities with HCI and design, particularly as CHI was chosen as the venue to publish the work. \  \ It can assist both industrial designers and interaction designers to collaborate with each other in fuzzy frond end of product development activities pervasively because it would be highly applicable to a large population of design based HCI research and also practice. \  \ R4: the paper could be improved by including more detail about the methodsand proper reporting style used for interviews etc. its not clear if these are a single set of reflective interviews on the past. or several interviews over stages of development etc. could be stronger and clearer. \  \ The interviews were done after the product was shipped and were held through the Internet. \  \ The interviews were transcribed and then sent to the interviewees for approval and information. The data were analyzed using Grounded Theory. The data gathered from the interviews were classified into groups (themes) which were identified before due to the literature review and the first phase of the field research. \  \  \ ","","","","","","Sep 26 05:34"

We discovered that our tool for modeling, CogTool, while sufficiently functional and expressive to perform the modeling task, did not support collaborative, distributed modeling as well as we would like.

Of ASIST 2002, 391-402. \  \ We addressed the difference between existing references and our work as follows. (please see the last three paragraphs of ‘Introduction’): \  \ Previous works mostly concern behavior (e.g., tagging, keeping, organizing) or UIs (e.g., bookmark, email) while ignoring diverse nature of content type. Our work explore the diverse content type to find holistic relationship among content type, behavior, and UIs, if any. \  \ [1] and [2] consider URL as a ‘pointer’ of a web page, which ignores the semantic aspects of the web content (= what do people want to keep? URL? Story? Image? Is the behavior affected by the content type?), while limits the focus to ‘mechanical’ value of URL. Thus, the effect of the content in URL keeping behavior was unclear. Our study does not limit our focus to URL, but widely opens the focus to any content format (e.g., URL, image, text) and type (e,g., news, entertainment, reference, SNS, etc.). \  \ [6] and [8] focus on multiple systems (email, bookmark, etc.) and behavior (keeping and re-finding that is transited by organizing). However, again, no concern on content type was found. Additionally, several concerns on functional analysis are outdated: information portability of paper document and multiple access point that do not share bookmarks. Those concerns are not applicable in these days’ current practice in which mobile and cloud computing is ubiquitous. \  \ Feedback 2: Explain how the content categories were arrived in our research \ Change: Add description to explain why we provide 7 content type. \  \ We added the description on Study overview >> Content type paragraph as follows. The paragraph explained how we discovered the importance of content type that may affect relevant behavior: Content-specific approach selection: \  \ “While creating use case scenarios for two approaches in Figure 2, we found that the selection of the approach, either passive delivery or active discovery, was highly dependent upon the content type. For a certain content type, one approach was highly applicable, while the other was not appropriate. For example, the passive delivery approach matches well with time-sensitive content (e.g., daily weather for bike riders) that is checked frequently or routinely with high probability to be disposed after being checked. Such content is likely to be pre-configured to assist reading experience. On the other hand, the active discovery implies the content that the exploration is situated and the consumption is associated with another content creation (e.g., list of shopping items to be reviewed and compared). Assuming that such difference reflects the nature of various content type, we selected seven content types to address diversity (Table 1) and included in the survey.” \  \ Change3: Design implication \  \ Add comparison of then [1,2,6,8] and now (our result) that affects changing paradigm towards mobile and cloud computing. \ Add graphical summary to explain content specific behavior explored in the behavior cycle (access, consume, keep, and organize),","","","","","","Oct 10 13:53"

The objective was to understand the level of need for website creation by such entrepreneurs for their businesses and further, the challenges associated with website design and maintenance. The study was inspired by the phenomenal uptake of Internet use in the country coupled with a need to explore how micro-entrepreneurs are faring in this space, what potential exists, and how it could be realized. The findings of the study show that the Internet can be the new frontier for many micro-entrepreneurs who want to take their businesses to the next level. The study also provides critical insights into the realities of micro-enterprise, and hence relevant issues to take into consideration in seeking to take micro-enterprise online.  The insights therein cover such issues as affordability of solutions, quick return on investment, convergence of current business methods and practices with those presented by an online environment for greater impact, and need for very simple, intuitive web design tools and platforms. Innovation may be required so as to come up with more website options that are better suited to the needs of micro-entrepreneurs and that are cost-effective. Alternatively other internet-based tools or platforms could be developed to help micro-entrepreneurs conduct business online. This is because the typical websites of today are not necessarily suitable for their needs.

Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding. However, they tend to focus only on the virtual side of sociality, and downplay the role of physicality in social interaction. In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging.  Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise.  However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions.","\\bibitem{Ada07} \ P.~Adams. \ \\newblock Communication mapping: understanding anyone's social network in 60 \   minutes. \ \\newblock In {\\em Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Designing for User \   eXperiences}, DUX '07, pages 7:1--7:8, New York, NY, USA, 2007.

This case study examines the steps designers took to foster a community of inquiry within the game. Designers played characters in the game, allowing them to be responsive to players’ activities and accumulating knowledge. Players were drawn to the narrative and close relationships they developed with the designers’ characters and other players. An informal and communal reward system was used to further nurture collaboration among the community. Findings suggest games like this one show promise for fostering science identity and scientific inquiry.","[1]	Asbell-Clarke, J., Edwards, T, Larsen, J., Rowe, E., Sylvan, E., Hewitt, J. (2011).

With more people actively engaging in this activity and increasing investment in this industry, this case study performs the first detailed investigation into information-seeking behaviors and information needs of online fantasy sports players.  Two online fantasy sports were studied: fantasy football and NASCAR. Common themes from one-on-one interviews with active fantasy sports players are discussed and areas for future research identified.

Prior research paid attention to warnings, response activities and the dissemination of information through social media during times of crisis. This study focuses on the use of social media during crisis from different perspectives. In this paper, the implications of symbols that emerged in YouTube videos were examined. Social media can be a valuable medium immediately after disaster events for people in crisis and for others who are indirectly affected to seek spiritual and emotional support and to reconstruct their cultural value system and identity. This study also addresses that persistence and replay are crucial attributes in the design of social media tools for users to seek emotional support and to engage with others in larger space and time.

It takes a look at education challenges faced by African youth and the gaps that exist in the education systems. African youth have the potential to be frontrunners in socio-economic transformation in the continent. They need to be empowered to be able to play their part. The huge gaps between education policy and practice, and other problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers. This paper therefore proposes m-learning using mobile phones as a logical and viable channel of delivering education to African youth.","[1] 	Population Reference Bureau. 2010 World Population Data Sheet, Population Reference Bureau, Washington,DC, 2010. \ [2] 	Outlook: Africa is recovering but there are risks,  http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/outlook/   \ [3] 	UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

We brought Telenoid, a tele-operated humanoid robot, into a classroom at an elementary school to see how schoolchildren respond to it. Our study is exploratory and we focused on the social aspects that might facilitate communication between schoolchildren. We found that Telenoid affected the way children work as group. They participated in the group work more positively, became more spontaneous, and differentiated their roles. We observed that Telenoid's limited capability led them to change their attitudes so that they could work together. The result suggests that the limited functionality may facilitate cooperation among participants in classroom setting.","1. Buxton, W.

In the revised version, we avoided the use of contractions and edited the paper for language issues. At the end of the paper on pages 13 to 15, we discussed creating the spontaneous urge of interlocutors to take the role of helping the robot’s operator, and the future work of investigating the merits and conditions of minimized or restricted communication in various ways. We also discussed the limitations in the current work, in terms of the influence of the training children received for using Telenoid before the experiment, and the one of the actual physical distance between the tele-operator and the other children.","","","","","","Oct  9 06:56"

Furthermore, the illustration of the data for the subsequent design process can be difficult, if different partners are involved in a project. In order to overcome these difficulties, we are exploring a decision diagram for the creation of personas. It aims at identifying the most appropriate approach (i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative data collection), taking into account the characteristics of the special user groups among other aspects.

The method enables not only the quantification of arousing emotional states but also their disambiguation into positive or negative instances. The physiological channel targets sympathetic responses and is materialized as a perspiratory signal extracted from thermal imagery of the perinasal area. The observational channel is materialized via decoding of facial expressions. However, while such decoding is usually performed in the visible spectrum, the authors have developed an algorithm to carry this out in thermal imagery instead. Thus, thermal imaging is used for both physiological and observational analysis. The potential of this dual unobtrusive methodology is demonstrated with some examples from a stress study, where users (surgeons in this case) interact with laparoscopic training boxes.","@Article{PAMI, \ 	author	=	{Buddharaju, P. and Pavlidis, I. and Tsiamyrtzis, P.  and Bazakos, M.}, \ 	title	=	{Physiology-based face recognition in the thermal infrared spectrum}, \ 	journal	=	{IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence}, \ 	volume	=	{29}, \ 	number	=	{4}, \ 	pages	=	{613-26}, \ 	year	=	{2007}, \ } \  \ @Book{Ekman03, \   author    = {Ekman, P.}, \   title     = {Emotions revealed}, \   publisher = {Times}, \   address   = {New York, NY, USA}, \   year      = {2003}, \ } \  \ @Book{Ekman02, \   author    = {Ekman, P. and Friesen, W. and Hager, J.

The methodology can be valuable for other visualization tools, e.g. in personal informatics.","Sten Govaerts","sten.govaerts@cs.kuleuven.be","Text structure: \ --------------- \ R1: “This work is tackling an important set of problems  in distance learning and it is doing so through a long-term, iterative design process that is taking user feedback very seriously. For these reasons, I find this work to be compelling.” \ R2: “The presentation of the submission is a little odd: although this is presented as an iterative design process, the description of the system’s evolution suggests that each iteration is extremely small, requiring only a few lines of text to describe. It feels like the authors have tried a little too hard to force this into the form of an end-to-end development case study. In this sense, the authors may be selling themselves short. The scope, variety, and real world nature of the user studies is actually probably the strongest feature of this work, and the authors should highlight this rather than the iterative design process.” \  \ Answer: \ R2 argues that the structure of our paper is too rigid because it is structured along the iterative design and implementation of our tool. R1 argues that the whole iterative process of design, development and user feedback makes the paper compelling. Therefore we maintained the current iterative structure of the paper and we stressed the user study diversity more in the introduction, design and conclusion sections. \  \ Lessons-learned: \ ---------------- \ R1: “The major concern I have about the significance of this contribution is how the readers will be able to draw out lessons or take-away messages from this paper that will be relevant to their own work, not only to the development of SAM.” \ R1: “I really wish that the authors had drawn out clearer take-away messages for the readers so that I could say that this was a clearer contribution to the CHI community, e.g., saying much more about how these findings would inform the design of personal informatics or health monitoring systems.” \ R1: “The major area for improvement in this paper is elaborating upon the implications for design, research methods, or theory that would be useful to researchers and practitioners, who are not necessarily working on SAM itself. While the results (and especially the conclusions for each of the sets of the results) are insightful, I was expecting a much broader set of conclusions that would provide take-away messages or directions for future research for readers, not simply a description of the next round of user testing SAM.” \  \ Answer: \ We added a section to the conclusion dedicated to lessons-learned and take-away messages from our experience designing, implementing and evaluating our tool.  \  \  \ Where does the data come from? \ ------------------------------ \ R2: “My only other concern is that the data used to generate the statistics are a little unclear. We are told what the source is, but is it not clear how this translates into usable data for the system. This could potentially be a useful technical contribution with practical value to those implementing similar systems (although this is perhaps not so much of a CHI contribution).” \  \ Answer: \ Explaining the gritty details of the algorithm that transforms log events into time spent data requires quite some space. The two papers referred to in Iteration 1, 2 and 3 also contain a bit more information on this topic. Therefore we added a brief section on this in the camera-ready version of the paper (see Iteration 2 > Evaluation with CGIAR Teachers > Evaluation Data), because we believe that this is not our major contribution. \  \ Spelling: \ --------- \ R1: “Copy edit through the paper for grammatical errors, especially maintaining a consistent past or present tense, not skipping back and forth between the two.” \  \ Answer: \ We edited the manuscript for spelling mistakes and improved the use of past and present tense. \  \ Tables into charts: \ ------------------- \ R1: “Turn tables 2-4 into charts.” \  \ Answer: \ We have created box plots out of the Likert scale analysis of Tables 2, 3 and 4.  \  \ More screenshots: \ ----------------- \ R1: “Provide more screen shots of the different iterations of the SAM interfaces.” \  \ Answer: \ We, of course, would love to include more screenshots of the UI during the first 3 iterations. Because, we are quite limited in space, we cannot add a readable screenshot of every iteration as this would add 1 to 2 pages of extra content. We tried to include screenshots in the margins, but this is not very readable. Instead, we have decided to explicitly describe and refer in the paper that there are the screenshots of each iteration available in the papers that describe the first 3 iterations in more detail. \  \ Placement of screenshots: \ ------------------------- \ R2: “It would be helpful to place Figure 2 closer to the bulk of the text describing it, to prevent the author needing to keep looking forward. Some of the details of this image, particularly those identified by colour, are difficult to discern when printed black and white.” \  \ Answer: \ We tried to put Figure 2 closer to the start of the section describing it (it actually is at the moment in the section but at the end). To do so, we would then need to push Table 1 (with the overview of the different iterations) into the section before where it is actually described. We believe that this might cause more confusion with readers than having the screenshots slightly further on. Therefore, we decided to leave the figure where it currently is. \  \ We also added labels to the items in the screenshots that were identified in the text with colors, to make sure that the screenshots would be readable when printed in black and white. \  \ Revision of result sections: \ ---------------------------- \ R1: “Consider revising the results sections into more coherent stories. The mini conclusion paragraphs at the end of the results sections are nice; please consider using that kind of writing style throughout the results sections.” \  \ Answer: \ We reworked the results sections partially to make them more coherent in style and content. \  \ Font: \ ------- \ R2: “The typeface used in the submitted document isnít the normal one. If the authors donít have Verdana, there are a number of closer matches available (DejaVu Sans, Bitstream Vera Sans, Tahoma etc.)” \  \ Answer: \ This issue has been resolved by using the latest template provided on the CHI’12 website, as can be seen in the camera-ready version.","","","","","","Oct  7 19:24"

We also elaborate on aspects of the evaluations that are specific to a marginalized, functionally illiterate, group in a developed country – aspects that are less frequently present in similar studies of mobile literacy support technologies in developing countries. We conclude with presenting the lessons learnt from our evaluations and the impact of the studies' specific challenges on the outcome and uptake of such mobile assistive technologies in providing practical support to low-literacy adults in conjunction with literacy and essential skills training.","[1] ABC Canada (2001).

The musical tunes can be modulated by our numerical acoustic simulator to create believable acoustic effects generated due to cavity in instruments such as drums. It further allows the users to change the materials, shapes, and sizes of the instruments, thereby offering the capability for both rapid prototyping and active exploration of sound effects by altering various physical parameters.

The ubiquity of pen-enabled technologies in teaching has made the accurate capture of user ink data possible, alongside technologies to recognize voice data.  When annotating on a white board or other presentation surface, teachers often have a specific style of structuring contents taught in a lecture.  The availability of sketch data and voice data can enable researchers to analyze trends followed by teachers in writing and annotating notes.  Using ethnographic methods, we have observed the structure that teachers use while presenting lectures on mathematics. We have observed the practices followed by teachers in writing and speaking the lecture content, and have derived models that would help computer scientists identify the structure of the content. This observational study motivates the idea that we can use speech and color change events to distinguish between strokes meant for drawing versus those meant for attention marks. \ ","1.
