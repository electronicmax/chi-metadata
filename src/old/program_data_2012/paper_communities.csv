Recently, canvas presentation tools such as Fly or Prezi have begun to use a zoomable free-form canvas to arrange information instead. While their effect on authoring presentations has been evaluated previously, we studied how they impact the audience. In a quantitative study, we compared audience retention and macrostructure understanding of slide deck vs. canvas presentations. We found both approaches to be equally capable of communicating information to the audience. Canvas presentations, however, were rated by participants to better aid them in staying oriented during a talk. This makes canvas presentation tools a promising slideware alternative.",Applic.,Refinement,Note

paper592,"design, arts",DiskPlay: In-Track Navigation on Turntables,Florian,Heller,"Florian Heller, Jan Borchers",Augmented Reality and Tangible UI; Tangible UIs; Creativity Support Tools,"Although digital media playback and storage has several advantages, the direct manipulation of the record and the haptics of the turntable makes vinyl the preferred tool for many DJs. The physical structure of traditional vinyl provides several cues for in-track navigation such as track length or the mood of the song. Digital vinyl systems use a timecode record to combine the advantages of digital playback with the handling DJs are used to. The record contains a special audio signal that is processed by a computer and mapped to information such as playback speed, direction, and absolute position. However, the visualization is separated from the control and due to their generic nature, timecode records do not provide visual information for in-track navigation. DiskPlay augments a timecode record with visual cues known from traditional vinyl or common DJ practice. In an observational study with four professional DJs the system was received very well and showed to reduce the number of focus switches.",Cap. & Mod.,Innov. & Vis.,Note

The essay has three parts. In the first, I review a range of theoretical work that has emerged from research through design, and use two influential theories from the Philosophy of Design to help reflect on the nature of design theory. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should embrace its theories as provisional, inspirational and annotative, its diversity as a positive implication of its field of investigation, and its tendency to produce an endless string of artefacts as its highest goal.",S-Design,Argument,Paper

However, this interpretation of children’s ideas into viable designs and technical specifications presents the biggest challenge for the adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children. In particular, we will describe a workshop in which members of the design team aimed to make sense of the outcomes of the participatory activities and to translate them into a design brief. This brief needed to inspire and inform a large multidisciplinary team from outside of the visual design discipline: psychology, computer science and education. During the intense two days of the workshop we used design methods to shape the under-defined and ""wicked"" problem space with which we were faced. With this paper we aim to further the case for using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology. We found that the nature of our design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but that it required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements.",J-Design,Methodology,Paper

Because representation is the only medium that learners can make sense of imperceptible phenomena with, learners encounter challenges when trying to perceiving and conceptualizing imperceptible sizes. Existing studies imply that conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate imperceptible sizes, hence, a need for a novel representation that can alter the way learners perceive and conceptualize imperceptible size emerges. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation (temporal-aural-visual representation: TAVR), which uses temporal sense as a main modality for representing imperceptible smallness. In a prior study [27] we found that the time is a useful concept that can be used to support learners to perceive and conceptualize imperceptible spatial information and TAVR is effective for refining learners’ mental model of imperceptible sizes. In this paper, we introduce a follow-up research that explored how to best augment the temporal experience of imperceptible size. ",Cap. & Mod.,Innov. & Vis.,Paper

Video game developers frequently depend on tutorials to communicate information to new players, yet there is little published work that evaluates the impact of tutorials on game learnability. To examine this question in more depth, we implemented eight tutorial designs proposed in HCI literature in three video games, and evaluated their effects on player engagement and retention. We present results from a multivariate study of over 45,000 players showing that game complexity influences the effectiveness of tutorial designs. We found that tutorials had a surprisingly negligible effect on player engagement in casual online games. The presence of context-sensitive tutorials and on-demand help were useful in the more complex game we studied, but in the simpler casual games they generally had no effect, or in the case of on-demand help, a negative effect. Additionally, the interactive tutorials that teach specific concepts by restricting player freedom had no significant effects on player engagement in any of the three games. These results suggest that tutorials have unpredictable effects on players, may depend on the complexity of the game in question, and that developers should be aware of the risks of seemingly straightforward tutorial design strategies.",J-Design,Users,Paper

We found the communities fall short in supporting the whole person as evidenced by the separation of (1) clinical expertise generated by health professionals from patient expertise, and (2) patients’ quantified data from narrative experiences. Such separation in the design of these systems can lead to limitations in addressing patients’ interwoven medical and personal concerns. We discuss dilemmas and design implications for supporting the whole person in online patient communities. ",Applic.,Users,Note

We investigated how EMR was adapted to the complex clinical work environment and how doctors and nurses engaged in the adaptation process. In this paper, we present three cases in which ED clinicians designed workarounds in order to adapt to the new work practice. Our findings reveal a rich picture of ED clinicians’ active reinterpretation and modification of their work practice through their engagement with the system-in-use and its organizational and physical context. These findings call for the adaptation period in designing a social-technical system in healthcare settings to be critically considered as an active end-user design process, a negotiating process, and a re-routinized process.

We present an indoor navigation system called Navatar that allows for localization and navigation by exploiting the physical characteristics of indoor environments, taking advantage of the unique sensing abilities of users with visual impairments, and minimalistic sensing achievable with low cost accelerometers available in smartphones. Particle filters are used to estimate the user's location based on the accelerometer data as well as the user confirming the presence of anticipated tactile landmarks along the provided path. Navatar has a high possibility of large-scale deployment, as it only requires an annotated virtual representation of an indoor environment.

However, few studies have ethnographically observed design teams that use personas, and fewer studies have looked specifically at how designers linguistically invoke personas in their decision-making sessions. This discourse analysis of the decision-making sessions of designers at a top tier design firm reveals that although the designers dedicate much time researching, developing, and refining personas, personas themselves make relatively few appearances in the designers’ language during decision-making sessions. This study shows that, for persuasive ends, these designers, who are advocates of personas, routinely use other less precise and more designer-centric linguistic mechanisms in lieu of personas.

The suitability of the designs was analyzed using performance data, subjective feedback and an observational analysis. The findings from the study suggest that LL users perform better and prefer the proposed designs over a traditional web interface.",Applic.,Users,Paper

However, their lack of scalability is a major challenge for their wide adoption. In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define those gestures first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the ""wisdom of the crowd"", a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user’s personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction.",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper

In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. It is often assumed in HCI that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the process. In this case, when viewing student projects, it became visible that design is to a large extent driven by characteristics of available materials. Recent theories on agency provide a way of analyzing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components in a given phenomenon, rather than meanings ascribed by the singular actions of the designers. The notion of agency provided a focus on how the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contributed to the way that design  activity unfolds.  The results have implications for the conceptual language of material interaction as well as theoretical approaches for the understanding materiality in interaction design.",J-Design,Theory,Paper

We present findings from a large user study conducted in the medical domain that specifically examines the effect of domain knowledge on the nature of the trailblazing process and the value of the trails produced. We show that differences exist between experts’ and novices’ trailblazing behaviors and the trails they generate. Our findings improve our understanding of how searchers blaze trails and can help search engines make decisions about the trailblazing process, e.g., whether there is benefit in the additional costs involved in recruiting trailblazers with domain knowledge, or whether trails blazed by novices are sufficient.",B-People,Users,Paper

This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the  most appropriate instruction mechanism for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of instruction mechanism has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system. We are hopeful that our findings on the problem of collecting high quality movement data from human subjects would help developers to build better gesture recognition systems in the future.",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper

We conducted a study to investigate the natural use profiles of PTA, which describes the features of PTA in the course of normal pen use such as writing and drawing. First, the study reveals the ranges of PTA in normal pen use, which can distinguish pen events accidently occurring in normal drawing and writing from those used for mode switch. The natural use profiles also show that azimuth is least likely to cause false pen mode switching while tip pressure is most likely to cause false pen mode switching. Second, the study reveals correlations among various modalities, indicating that pressure plus azimuth is superior to other pairs for dual-modality control.",Cap. & Mod.,Refinement,Note

DiamondTouch does so reliably, but requires users to stay in assigned seats and cannot recognize users across sessions. We propose a different approach based on distinguishing users’ shoes. While users are interacting with the table, Bootstrapper observes their shoes using one or more depth cameras mounted to the edge of the table. It then identifies users by matching camera images with a database of known shoe images. When multiple users interact, Bootstrapper associates touches with shoes based on hand orientation. The approach can be implemented using consumer depth cameras because (1) shoes offer large distinct features such as color, (2) shoes naturally align themselves with the ground, giving the system a well-defined perspective and thus reduced ambiguity. We report a simple study in which Bootstrapper recognized participants from a database of 18 users with 89% accuracy, based on a single observed frame. ",Int. Techniques,Refinement,Note

Adopting tracheal intubation training as an example, we show the difficulty of teaching a novice to manipulate a laryngoscope. Although previous training systems tackled the issue by presenting force to the learner’s palm by directly actuating the laryngoscope, this approach is sometimes ineffective because learners typically have difficulty sensing the haptic feedback from the laryngoscope when they are holding it tightly. Thus, we propose a different approach (OCHD) that effectively guides the novice’s hand by presenting force to the back of his/her hand as if an expert is holding it.

Recent psychological studies have revealed that the consumption volume of food is influenced not only its real volume but also external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we aimed to control perception of satiety which is gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size and proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation.

It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to support the mid-air interaction design allows precise controllability with low resolution 3D scene acquisition systems that are low cost and widely available, such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor.

In conducting this investigation, we also extended the original Natural Programming methodology (a user-centered design method for HCI researchers of programming environments); we call the new method Natural Programming Plus. Natural Programming Plus makes explicit a method for mapping the outcomes of NP’s empirical investigations to a language design. Its aim is to provide a concrete method for computer scientists uncomfortable with the design leap from empirical assessment of users’ needs to a language. The contributions of our work are therefore: (1) the new Natural Programming Plus methodology, (2) empirical evidence about the content and sequence of modelers’ information needs when debugging, and (3) a new, empirically derived, design specification for a debugging interaction language for cognitive modelers.

By treating document length as an input to our gain functions, the method allows rapid document traversal regardless of document length. It also allows slow and precise scroll control at shorter distances. An initial experiment is used to characterise four diverse scrolling input devices – a standard ‘notched’ scroll wheel, a high performance ‘inertia’ wheel, an isometric scrolling joystick, and a trackpad – and the results are used to calibrate several gain function parameters. A second experiment validates the method, showing that it allows faster scrolling in long and short documents than current scrolling-device gain methods, and that subjective preferences favour it.

Reflect creates a space next to every comment where people can summarize and restate points they hear the commenter making. We evaluate Reflect through deployments on Slashdot (a technology news site), Wikimedia’s Strategic Planning Initiative, a civic engagement effort in Seattle, Washington, and an A/B tested discussion deployed to Mechanical Turk.

We believe that the sense of personal agency is a key factor in how people experience interactions with technology. This paper draws on theoretical perspectives in cognitive neuroscience and introduces two implicit metrics through which personal agency can be empirically investigated. We report two experiments applying these methods to HCI problems. One shows that a new input modality - skin-based interaction - can substantially increase users' sense of agency. The second demonstrates that assistance techniques such as predictive mouse acceleration are able to preserve users' sense of agency, up to a threshold that can be determined experimentally.

In lab studies, participants are presented with prescribed tasks, enabling easy identification of speeds and errors. In naturalistic use, no such prescriptions exist. We therefore devised novel algorithms to segment text entry and mouse pointing input streams into “trials.” We are also the first to measure errors for unprescribed text entry and mouse pointing. To measure errors, we utilize web search engines, adaptive offline dictionaries, an Automation API, and crowdsourcing. Capturing errors allows us to employ Crossman’s (1957) correction for normalizing speed-accuracy tradeoffs when calculating Fitts’ law throughputs. To validate the Input Observer, we compared its measures from 12 participants over a week of computer use to the same participants’ results from a lab study. Overall, in the lab and field, average text entry speeds were 74.47 WPM and 80.59 WPM, respectively. Average uncorrected error rates were near zero, at 0.12% and 0.28%.

Our study shows otherwise. \   \ We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver visual changes or notifications to the users \ ",K-People,Users,Paper

However, acquiring vocabulary is often a protracted process that requires repeated and spaced exposure; which can be difficult to accommodate given the busyness of daily living. In this paper, we explore if a learner can implicitly acquire second language vocabulary through her explicit interactions with her mobile phone (e.g., navigating multiple home screens) using an interface we developed called Vocabulary Wallpaper. In addition, we examine if the type of vocabulary this technique exposes to the learner, whether it is contextually relevant or contextually-independent will influence the learner’s rate of vocabulary acquisition. The results of our study show participants were able to use Vocabulary Wallpaper to increase the number of second language vocabulary that they can recognize and recall and their rate of vocabulary acquisition was significantly greater when presented with a contextually relevant vocabulary than a contextually-independent vocabulary.",Systems & Tools,Refinement,Paper

To ensure reliable results, they usually have to rely on carefully designed procedures, controlled environmental conditions, and direct supervision of participants. Such experiments are time consuming and are often a factor limiting the pace of innovation. As an alternative to controlling study conditions, we propose to collect data from remote, unsupervised participants, and automatically filter it for reliable observations. Building on a recent advance in machine learning, we developed a user-independent classifier capable of discriminating between deliberate, ballistic mouse pointer movements and those that are performed when participants are in any way distracted. We validate our approach in the context of an in-situ study using unobtrusive software that recorded participants' mouse pointer movements over the course of several weeks, while they naturally interacted with their computers. Each participant also performed a set of pointing tasks using a formal study set-up. Our results show that, on four distinct metrics, the data collected in-situ and filtered with our classifier closely matches the results obtained from the formal experiment. \ We hope that our method may enable faster, cheaper, and more scalable experimentation in areas where motor performance on simple pointing tasks is a measure of interest.",Int.

Prior work has noted challenges in justifying them to developers. In contrast, it has been assumed that that designers and user experience professionals—whose goal is to focus design efforts on targeted users—will understand and readily exploit personas. This paper examines that assumption. We studied how experienced user-centered practitioners use and perceive personas in real industrial software design, identifying specific limits to the persona approach. Practitioners used personas almost exclusively for communication, but not for design. Participants identified four problems with personas, finding them abstract, impersonal, misleading and distracting. There are direct implications for persona deployment. Personas cannot replace immersion in actual user data. And rather than focusing on creating engaging personas, it is critical to avoid personas that mislead or distract, arguing for a different approach to persona design and deployment.",S-Design,Methodology,Paper

This NGO subsidizes health facilities by paying for medical services on the basis of claims submitted after the patient consultation, targeting treatment of 99,000 clients between 2006-2011. I successfully tested Claim Mobile in Summer 2008, processing 35 claims over two weeks, and then discontinued it six months later, when it became apparent that integration and scale-up of the technology would be problematic for the NGO. In addition, many issues we hoped to address through technology had been addressed through program management changes instead.  I find that a) the context motivating the technology changed over time, b) simpler solutions can be as effective as new technologies, and c) prioritizing the needs of the NGO required abandoning the deployment of Claim Mobile. Thus this paper presents the implications for understanding the value of failure in the process of design.",Applic.,Users,Paper

Recovery requires daily exercise with a high number of repetitions often without therapist supervision. As a result, those people who do the exercises alone often do them incorrectly by compensating for their lack of motion in the joints targeted by exercises. This compensation can impede recovery progress and create new health issues. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) a therapeutically meaningful game that uses operant conditioning to reduce compensatory torso motion. Our evaluation results show that our game design significantly reduces compensatory motions compared to alternatives.",Applic.,Sys & Tools,Paper

This paper presents an objective evaluation of several methods for the automated segmentation and classification of ES intervals from an eye movement recording, a technique that can be utilized to aid in the identification of usability problems during software usability testing. Techniques considered for automated segmentation of the eye movement recording into unique intervals include mouse/keyboard events and eye movement scanpaths. ES is identified by a number of eye movement metrics, including: fixation count, saccade amplitude, convex hull area, scanpath inflections, scanpath length, and scanpath duration. The ES intervals identified by each algorithm are compared to those produced by manual classification to verify the accuracy, precision, and performance of each algorithm. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed by HCI experts during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy.",Usability,Methodology,Paper

In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections.

Tracking the mouse cursor is a cheap and scalable alternative to eye-tracking in some situations. Past research has correlated the gaze and cursor positions, and other lines of research have found the cursor to be useful in determining user intent and relevant parts of the Web page. However, there are many types of cursor behavior patterns such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, which have different meanings. We conduct an experiment with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the cursor-gaze alignment; the findings lead us to caution against the overly-general maxim that ""gaze is well approximated by cursor."" These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor.

The technology, tabletop in form, provides a central place where digital content, such as photos, can be easily archived, managed and viewed. The tabletop affords multi-touch input, allowing digital content to be sorted, triaged and interacted with using one or two handed interactions. A physics-based simulation adds dynamics to digital content, providing users with rich ways of interacting that borrows from the real-world. The field study is one of the first of a surface computer within a domestic environment and provides insights into how such novel technologies may be adopted and appropriated within the home. Our goal is to uncover people’s interactions, perceptions and experiences with such technologies, and what the potential barriers to use are. Given these devices provide such a revolutionary shift in interaction, will people be able to engage with them in everyday life in the ways we intend? In answering this question, we hope to deepen our understanding of the design of such systems for home and consumer domains. ",Cap. & Mod.,Innov. & Vis.,Paper

Current practice is anchored on the assumption that faces and names draw attention; the same presentation format is used independently of the social connection strength and the search query topic. The key findings of our experiments indicate room for improvement. First, only certain social contacts are useful sources of information, depending on the search topic. Second, faces surprisingly lose their well-documented power to draw attention when rendered small as part of a social search result annotation. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, the social annotations go largely unnoticed, in general, due to what seems to be a highly selective, structured, and optimized visual parsing behavior of users, specific to search result pages. We conclude by recommending improvements to the design of social annotations to make them more useful and noticeable.",J-People,Refinement,Paper

A novel real-time algorithm for representing hands and other physical objects, which are sensed by the Kinect inside this volume, allows physically realistic interaction between real and virtual 3D objects. A qualitative study demonstrates rich emergent 3D interactions, using hands and real-world objects. HoloDesk therefore allows users to directly interact with an aligned 3D virtual world, without the need for any specialized heads-worn hardware or input device, and thus permits a walk up-and-use experience.

However, dictation systems today utilize a speech interaction model that invites mental disruption: Users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. These utterances do not get transcribed until the user has finished speaking, at which point the entire output appears at once. Users must then break their train of thought, verify the output and correct errors, a process that can be both time-consuming and frustrating. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users’ utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For correction, users leverage a gesture-based marking menu that provides multiple ways of editing text. Voice Typing is akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, users not only reported lower mental demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of corrections.

To extend the reach of answers to thousands of new information needs, we introduce Tail Answers: a large collection of direct results that are unpopular individually, but together comprise a large proportion of search traffic. These answers cover long-tail needs like the CHI 2012 submission deadline, substitutes for molasses, and the keyboard shortcut for a right-click. To make Tail Answers possible, we aggregate the intelligence of thousands of everyday web users. Implicitly, they help us identify potential Tail Answers through their web search behavior, and explicitly they help us build the answer through crowdsourcing. Via a user study with 361 participants, we find that Tail Answers significantly improved users’ subjective ratings of search quality and ability to solve needs without clicking. Our findings suggest that search engines can now directly respond to a large new class of informational queries.",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper
paper263,", ",Dwell-and-Spring: Undo for Direct Manipulation,Caroline,Appert,"Caroline Appert, Olivier Chapuis, Emmanuel Pietriga",Input and Interaction Technologies; User Interface Design,"In graphical user interfaces, direct manipulation consists in incremental actions that should be reversible. Typical examples include manipulating geometrical shapes in a vector graphics editor, navigating a document using a scrollbar, or moving and resizing windows on the desktop. The last two examples differ from the first in that they are situated at the view level rather than at the functional level of the application. Consequently, as in many such cases, there will not be any mechanism to undo them, requiring users to manually revert to the previous state using a similar sequence of direct manipulation actions. The associated motor and cognitive costs can be high. We argue that proper and consistent mechanisms to support undo in this context are lacking, and present Dwell-and-Spring, an interaction technique that uses the metaphor of springs to enable users to undo direct manipulations. A spring widget pops up whenever the user dwells during a press-drag-release interaction, giving her the opportunity to either cancel the current manipulation or undo the last one. The technique is generic and can easily be implemented on top of existing applications to complement the traditional undo command. Empirical evaluation shows that users quickly adopt it as soon as they discover it.",Int. Techniques,Refinement,Paper

We investigated the combination of a horizontal and a vertical display, which together form a digital workspace. In particular, we were interested in the effect that the physical transition (bezel, edge and curve) has on dragging tasks. In a study participants performed dragging tasks across vertically aligned display planes with direct touch as well as pointer. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant effect on the task completion time. Only regarding accuracy the curved transition performed better than edge and bezel. Interestingly, the subjective judgment did generally not match the objective results. These findings suggest that we need to rethink our understanding of display continuities in terms of their usability as well as user satisfaction.",Int. Techniques,Refinement,Note

Our study extends the original experiment with the incorporation of touch and tilt interaction techniques, in order to determine if these affect the use and acquisition of spatial skills. Results suggest that the task is performed faster, and with no significant difference in accuracy when participants rely on mental abilities, rather than interaction techniques, to perform 3D rotations.

As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over event streams. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it can automatically create a recognizer for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time. Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions. We present the architecture and implementation of Proton, along with three proof-of-concept applications. These applications demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework, and show how Proton simplifies gesture definition and conflict resolution.",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper

Common approach-es to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. How-ever, these authentication methods are vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. The risk of such attacks has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can create a video of the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to video-based shoulder surfing at-tacks. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attacker. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that within a 92% confidence interval, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible log-in attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods.",Systems & Tools,Users,Note

For users with visual impairment, or when occupied with another task that requires a user’s visual attention, these phones can be difficult to use. Recently, marks initiating from the bezel, the physical touch-insensitive frame surrounding a touchscreen display, have been proposed as a method for eyes-free interaction. Due to the physical form factor of the mobile device, it is possible to access different parts of the bezel eyes-free. In this paper, we first studied the performance of different bezel menu layouts. Based on the results, we designed a bezel-based text entry application to gain insights into how bezel menus perform in a real-world application. From a longitudinal study, we found that the participants achieved 9.2 words per minute in situations requiring minimal visual attention to the screen. After only one hour of practice, the participants transitioned from novice to expert users. This shows that bezel menus can be adopted for realistic applications.",Int. Techniques,Refinement,Paper

To explore this potential, we introduce and evaluate two novel personalized keyboard interfaces that adapt their underlying key-press classification models. Additionally, we explore the effect of visualizing the location of the adapted keys versus maintaining a visually stable rectangular layout. A three-session user evaluation showed that the adaptive keyboard that does not visually change significantly improved typing speed compared to a static control condition. Although the visually adaptive keyboard did not offer a similar benefit, overall subjective response to both of the new keyboards was positive. As personalized keyboards are still an emerging area of research, we outline a design space that includes dimensions of adaptation and key-press classification features.",Int.

Distributed sensemaking would allow a user’s sensemaking efforts to be leveraged at a later time by others users without the users directly collaborating or even knowing one another. We asked users to engage in sensemaking by organizing and annotating web search results into “knowledge maps,” either with or without previous users’ maps to work from. We also recorded gaze patterns as users examined others’ knowledge maps.  We found that distributed sensemaking can improve sensemaking quality, that a user’s sensemaking process is readily apparent to a subsequent user via a knowledge map, and that content organization was more useful to subsequent users than was the content itself.  We discuss the role distributed sensemaking can play in schema induction (helping users make a mental model of an information space) and make recommendations for tools and systems that can be developed in order to best support this type of distributed sensemaking.",Beyond Indiv.,Users,Paper

To support this input, widely adopted commercial touch-screen interfaces require mode switches to alternate keyboard layouts for most punctuation and symbols. Our approach is to augment existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set included both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted an evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface. ",Int. Techniques,Refinement,Note

Recoloring tools exist, but these all use abstract models of only a few types of congenital CVD; if the user’s color problems have a different cause, existing recolorers can perform poorly. We have developed a recoloring technique based on the idea of situation-specific modeling (SSM) – in which we build a performance-based model of a particular user in their specific environment, and use that model to drive the recoloring process. SSM allows a recolorer to cover a much wider range of CVDs, including acquired and situational deficiencies. We evaluated our SSM-based recolorer against two existing systems in a controlled study where we compared people’s color-matching performance under several environmental conditions. The study included participants with congenital CVD and those without CVD. Our results show that the SSM-based recolorer allowed significantly better accuracy and response time in color- matching tasks. This work demonstrates the value of a situation-specific approach to recoloring, and shows that this technique can substantially improve the usability of color displays for users of all types.",Usability,Sys & Tools,Paper

Thus in safety-critical environments, it is often considered safer to perform tasks sequentially. Here we explore how the cost of accessing information affects how people choose to interleave. An empirical study based on a medical scenario was conducted. Participants had to program infusion pump devices using information from a prescription form. The physical and mental effort involved in accessing information was manipulated. This was achieved by simply moving the prescription form. Once trained on how to program one device, participants were free to decide how they interleaved the programming of two devices. We demonstrate that by increasing the information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing a subgoal. Interleaving at other points disrupts subgoal execution, which can result in task steps being forgotten.",K-People,Users,Note

Some, such as smart phones and tablets, may not have a keyboard at all. However, most multi-touch devices still use typed text passwords for authentication. Typing on a glass screen, often on a smaller surface area, leads users to select weak, short passwords. It is a well known problem in authentication that users are rarely able to stick to recommendations for creating strong passwords. We propose taking advantage of the multi-touch surface to combine biometric techniques with gestural input. We defined a comprehensive set of five-finger touch gestures, based upon classifying movement characteristics of the center of the palm and fingertips, and tested them all in a user study that combined biometric data collection with usability questions. Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize the unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual user. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate when using single gestures, and saw a significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found that user ratings of a gesture’s desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gesture’s actual biometric recognition rate--that is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords.

We present PixIO, a new cost-effective, light-weight device that solves this issue. It both shares physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces and provides rich referential awareness. To evaluate PixIO, we studied pairs of children playing remotely. They used PixIO to share the task-reference space and Skype Video to share the person space. The study results show that PixIO shared the play space in a natural and seamless way. We also found that children preferred having both spaces compared to having only one. Moreover, we found that removing the task-reference space caused stronger negative disruptions to the play task and engagement level than removing the person space. Similarly, we found that adding the task-reference space resulted in stronger positive disruptions.",Beyond Indiv.,Users,Paper
paper1817,health,It’s Complicated: How Romantic Partners Use Facebook,Xuan,Zhao,"Xuan Zhao, Victoria Schwanda, Dan Cosley","Computer-Mediated Communication; Empirical Methods, Quantitative; Privacy","Romantic partners face issues of relational development \ including managing information privacy, tension between \ individual and relational needs, and accountability to \ existing friends. Prior work suggests that affordances of \ social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to \ explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two \ weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and \ others’ Facebook use related to their relationship for two \ weeks. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when \ romantic partners must manage multiple relationships \ simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present \ and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation \ around and appropriation of Facebook’s features to \ accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing \ both why people make these decisions and how Facebook’s \ affordances support them, we expect many of our insights \ to apply to studying other social media tools and designing \ new ones.",J-People,Users,Paper

Much of this research has been pursued in labs and brief field studies. Comparatively little is known about social agents embedded in the workplace, where employees have repeated interactions with the agent, alone and with others. We designed a social robot delivery service for a workplace, and evaluated this service over four months. We report on how employees responded to the robot and the service over repeated encounters. Despite employees’ knowledge of the robot as a machine, their encounters became surprisingly social, and social norms developed around treating the robot as workgroup member. Deliveries became workplace social events. We discuss the implications of these ripple effects for designing services incorporating social agents.",Beyond Indiv.,Users,Paper

As a result users must differentiate and choose the most suitable workflow for their task. We present Delta, an interactive workflow visualization and comparison tool that helps users identify the tradeoffs between workflows. We conducted an initial study to identify the set of workflow attributes users consider when comparing workflows, finding that users consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future.",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper

Users struggled to install and configure blocking lists to make effective use of blocking tools. They often erroneously concluded the tool was blocking OBA when they had not properly configured it to do so. \ ",Applic.,Users,Paper
paper1944,", ",Designing Social Translucence over Networks,Eric,Gilbert,Eric Gilbert,Social Computing and Social Navigation; Computer-Mediated Communication,"Social translucence is a landmark theory in social computing. Modeled on physical life, it guides designers toward elegant social technologies. However, we argue that it breaks down over modern social network sites because social networks resist its physical metaphors. Bridging this gap, we introduce a new theory called structural social translucence, relating triads to the design problems they cause. To explore the theory, we built a tool called notab.ly. Notab.ly addresses a triadic awareness problem by letting users know how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly 150K people used notab.ly a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread, viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by illustrating applications of structural social translucence, arguing that new design problems lie at the intersection of social translucence and unexplored triads.",Beyond Indiv.,Theory,Paper

paper1970,", ",Semantic Interaction in Spatializations of Text Datasets,Alex,Endert,"Alex Endert, Patrick Fiaux, Chris North",Visualization,"Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking through interactively exploring visualizations of large, complex datasets. Using statistical models, datasets are visualized and users are able to make sense of the data. For example, large textual datasets can be visualized in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are represented through their relative spatial distances from other documents. By in large, users interact with such visualizations through visual controls, such as moving sliders, traversing menus, or entering values into text fields. Often, these interactions (or changes) correspond directly to parameters of the underlying statistical model of the visualization. However, once users are able to relate to the information within the visualization spatially, how can we design visualizations where they can also interact spatially? That is, how can we design visualizations with interactions that stay within the metaphor? In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, semantic interaction, where users can interact in the spatial metaphor created by the visualization. Further, we show how semantic interactions can be integrated into a visual analytic tool, ForceSPIRE, used for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization.

paper1978,", ",Interpretation and Trust: Designing Model-Driven Visualizations for Text Analysis,Jason,Chuang,"Jason Chuang, Daniel Ramage, Christopher Manning, Jeffrey Heer",Visualization; Database access / Information Retrieval; User-Centered Design / Human-Centered Design,"Statistical topic models can help analysts discover patterns in large text corpora by identifying recurring sets of words and enabling exploration by topical concepts. However, under- standing and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations--interpretation and trust--for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the (Anonymized) Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of ""word-borrowing"" and show how it arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.",Cap. & Mod.,Refinement,Paper

For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. The research base suggests that having to practice recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve our word reading skill – including reading in a second language – far more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. We discuss three major contributions of this work. First, through a working prototype, we demonstrate the technical feasibility of speech recognition that needs to account for diverse, low-resource contexts. Second, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) that speech recognition supports is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to “unpack” factors in the learner’s linguistic knowledge that may impact reading. Third, we discuss what our results suggest for future research in HCI.",Applic.,Sys & Tools,Paper

However, programming multi-touch gestures remains an art. It is time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to handle the complicated touch state transitions resulted from the increasing number of fingers and their simultaneous movements. In this paper, we present Gesture Coder, a tool that automatically generates code for recognizing each state of multi-touch gestures and invoking corresponding application actions, based on a few gesture examples given by the developer. The generated code can be easily integrated into a project by developers. We evaluated Gesture Coder using a within-subject study in which participants were asked to implement a set of multi-touch interactions with and without Gesture Coder. The results overwhelmingly showed that Gesture Coder significantly lowered the threshold of programming multi-touch gestures. ",Systems & Tools,Sys & Tools,Paper
