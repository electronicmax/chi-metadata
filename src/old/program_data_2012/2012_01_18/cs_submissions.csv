How were initial problems with Acrobat identified, we could do with some method here to make this clear to the reader. \  \ In the Beginning section, more specifically we listed the 9 areas of design enhancements during our design planning phase. Per review comment, we removed the term “matrix” since it can be confusing. We iterated this was simply a prioritization and negotiation exercise with PM. (page 2). \  \ 2. How were the guiding design principles formulated? What led you to pick them? \  \ The rationale of the two guiding design principles was added on page 4. \  \ 3. What research did you do that showed that your work had been well received by users (in the task panes section of the paper)? \  \ In the Task Panes section we now describe how we evaluated the designs to see that they were being well received (page 8) \  \ 4. You talk about using user metrics in passing but you have such an enormous base to gather thins information from I think it would be fascinating to hear more about this. \  \ In the Task Panes section on page 8, we now describe the behavior metrics which Adobe collects. We added the official program name and provided a link to more information about how this works (in the footnote and Citations section).  \  \ 5. In user testing I would welcome some more detail about exactly how many people you were working with an each point in the process. \  \ On page 10 in the ""Research Consisted Primarily of Iterative Test-and-Refine Studies"" section, detail is now provided about the sample size in the usability testing iterations. \  \ 6. When you talk about Matrixís for use with the product management team I wasn’t really clear what you meant, I think you need to be a bit more careful with defining your terms.  In a similar vein, I wasn’t entirely clear on the roles and responsibilities of the PM team, obviously I can take a guess but I think this caries a bit from company to company so perhaps you could make this more explicit as well. \  \ The definition of Product Management (PM) was added to the paper as footnote (page 2). \  \ Other revisions: \  \ 7. All figures are now within the textual content. A figure showing the difference between Acrobat 9 & X was added so it’s easier for readers to get a brief idea (page 3). \  \ 8. On page 13, more details were added to the “Group Usability Testing” section. \  \ 9. Changed the section title from “Key Takeaways & Conclusion” to “Lessons Learned” and provided more thoughts about what we learned and how we would do it differently next time. \  \ 10. Thanks to Elizabeth Buie’s help, quite a lot of format issues for paragraph, subheads, numbers wording were fixed. \ ","","H.5.2","","","","","Oct  7 21:09"

This is especially meaningful for projects that have taken place over a long period of time and with consistent overall direction. In this case study, we reflect back over the design of an information gathering and management system built for students in higher education. We demonstrate how users can be involved in various ways over a development period that spans many years; we show that designs of different fidelities can effectively garner user feedback; and we illustrate the impact of multiple influences, including users, research team members, and resource limitations on the overall transformation of the system. We conclude with a series of lessons learned that we hope will help future researchers plan and execute their own design-implement-evaluate lifecycles.","References \ [1]	Amento, B., Terveen, L., Hill, W., & Hix, D.

In contrast, we used predictive human performance modeling in a collaborative, distributed mode and reflect on that experience. We discovered that our tool for modeling, CogTool, while sufficiently functional and expressive to perform the modeling task, did not support collaborative, distributed modeling as well as we would like.  We suggest process improvements in model construction, the management of assumptions, consistency, and communication, and suggest design solutions for the future of CogTool or other modeling tools.

Of ASIST 2002, 391-402. \  \ We addressed the difference between existing references and our work as follows. (please see the last three paragraphs of ‘Introduction’): \  \ Previous works mostly concern behavior (e.g., tagging, keeping, organizing) or UIs (e.g., bookmark, email) while ignoring diverse nature of content type. Our work explore the diverse content type to find holistic relationship among content type, behavior, and UIs, if any. \  \ [1] and [2] consider URL as a ‘pointer’ of a web page, which ignores the semantic aspects of the web content (= what do people want to keep? URL? Story? Image? Is the behavior affected by the content type?), while limits the focus to ‘mechanical’ value of URL. Thus, the effect of the content in URL keeping behavior was unclear. Our study does not limit our focus to URL, but widely opens the focus to any content format (e.g., URL, image, text) and type (e,g., news, entertainment, reference, SNS, etc.). \  \ [6] and [8] focus on multiple systems (email, bookmark, etc.) and behavior (keeping and re-finding that is transited by organizing). However, again, no concern on content type was found. Additionally, several concerns on functional analysis are outdated: information portability of paper document and multiple access point that do not share bookmarks. Those concerns are not applicable in these days’ current practice in which mobile and cloud computing is ubiquitous. \  \ Feedback 2: Explain how the content categories were arrived in our research \ Change: Add description to explain why we provide 7 content type. \  \ We added the description on Study overview >> Content type paragraph as follows. The paragraph explained how we discovered the importance of content type that may affect relevant behavior: Content-specific approach selection: \  \ “While creating use case scenarios for two approaches in Figure 2, we found that the selection of the approach, either passive delivery or active discovery, was highly dependent upon the content type. For a certain content type, one approach was highly applicable, while the other was not appropriate. For example, the passive delivery approach matches well with time-sensitive content (e.g., daily weather for bike riders) that is checked frequently or routinely with high probability to be disposed after being checked. Such content is likely to be pre-configured to assist reading experience. On the other hand, the active discovery implies the content that the exploration is situated and the consumption is associated with another content creation (e.g., list of shopping items to be reviewed and compared). Assuming that such difference reflects the nature of various content type, we selected seven content types to address diversity (Table 1) and included in the survey.” \  \ Change3: Design implication \  \ Add comparison of then [1,2,6,8] and now (our result) that affects changing paradigm towards mobile and cloud computing. \ Add graphical summary to explain content specific behavior explored in the behavior cycle (access, consume, keep, and organize),","","H.5.1","","","","","Oct 10 13:53"

Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding. However, they tend to focus only on the virtual side of sociality, and downplay the role of physicality in social interaction. In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging.  Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise.  However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions.","\\bibitem{Ada07} \ P.~Adams. \ \\newblock Communication mapping: understanding anyone's social network in 60 \   minutes. \ \\newblock In {\\em Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Designing for User \   eXperiences}, DUX '07, pages 7:1--7:8, New York, NY, USA, 2007.

Prior research paid attention to warnings, response activities and the dissemination of information through social media during times of crisis. This study focuses on the use of social media during crisis from different perspectives. In this paper, the implications of symbols that emerged in YouTube videos were examined. Social media can be a valuable medium immediately after disaster events for people in crisis and for others who are indirectly affected to seek spiritual and emotional support and to reconstruct their cultural value system and identity. This study also addresses that persistence and replay are crucial attributes in the design of social media tools for users to seek emotional support and to engage with others in larger space and time.

This pilot study with 14 pairs of elderly-teenager participants shows that general attitude towards the other age group improves after a period of playing.

However, functional illiteracy is a challenge encountered by up to 50% of adults in developed countries. In this paper we reflect on the challenges we faced in trying to design and study the use of a mobile application to support adult literacy with two user groups: adults enrolled in literacy classes and carpenters without a high school education enrolled in an essential skills program.  We also elaborate on aspects of the evaluations that are specific to a marginalized, functionally illiterate, group in a developed country – aspects that are less frequently present in similar studies of mobile literacy support technologies in developing countries. We conclude with presenting the lessons learnt from our evaluations and the impact of the studies' specific challenges on the outcome and uptake of such mobile assistive technologies in providing practical support to low-literacy adults in conjunction with literacy and essential skills training.","[1] ABC Canada (2001).

In addition, users take part in the distribution of services by recommending services to each other, i.e. through various word-of-mouth \ practices. To understand the current patterns of user-initiated service distribution, we conducted an exploratory survey study (N=203) to investigate the recommendation practices and motivations of mobile service users in situations where they recommend to other(s) and other(s) recommend to them. We found that the dominating way to recommend mobile services to others is to tell about the service in face-to-face situations, despite available support for electronic sharing in mobile situations. Social media was also used, but clearly less frequently. Based on the findings of this study, we present design ideas for supporting \ users in their recommendation practices.","[1]Ahmet, Z., Väänänen-Vainio Mattila, K.
