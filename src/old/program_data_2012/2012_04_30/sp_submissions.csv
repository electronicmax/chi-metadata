An ameliorative discipline of both theory and practice, somaesthetics seeks to enrich not only our discursive knowledge of the body but also our lived somatic experience and performance; it aims to improve the meaning, understanding, efficacy, and beauty of our movements and of the environments to which our actions contribute and from which they also derive their energies and significance. To pursue these aims, somaesthetics is concerned with a wide diversity of knowledge forms and discourses, social practices and institutions, cultural traditions, values, and bodily disciplines that structure (or could improve) such somatic understanding and cultivation. As an interdisciplinary project that is not confined to one dominant academic field, professional vocabulary, cultural ideology, or particular set of bodily disciplines, somaesthetics aims to provide an overarching theoretical structure and a set of basic and versatile conceptual tools to enable a more fruitful interaction and integration of the very diverse forms of somatic knowledge currently being practiced and pursued. My talk at CHI will present the fundamental principles of the somaesthetic, examine some of its interdisciplinary impact and then explore its possible applications to the field of interactive design. \  \ BIO: Richard Shusterman is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities at Florida Atlantic University, where he is also Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Center for Body, Mind, and Culture: http://www.fau.edu/bodymindculture/. His primary research focus is the field of somaesthetics, which evolved in the late nineties from his work in pragmatist philosophy and aesthetics. Author of Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (Cambridge University Press, 2008), Shusterman has also written Surface and Depth (2002); Performing Live (2000); Practicing Philosophy (1997); Sous l’interprétation (1994), Soma-esthétique et architecture: une alternative critique (2010), and Pragmatist Aesthetics (1992, 2000, and translated into fourteen languages). Formerly chair of the Philosophy Department of Temple University (Philadelphia), he has held academic appointments in France, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Japan, and has been awarded research grants from the NEH, Fulbright, ACLS, Humboldt Foundation, and UNESCO. In 2008 the French government awarded him the rank of Chevalier in the Order of Academic Palms for his cultural contributions. His exploratory research in somaesthetics is informed by his professional practice as a somatic educator and therapist in the Feldenkrais Method.","","","","","","","Richard Shusterman","shuster1@fau.edu","","","","Mar 19 04:06",""

Card","stuart.card@gmail.com","Human-Computer Interaction now is almost a different discipline than at the time of the first CHI conference. The field has moved from command-line interfaces for time-sharing to gesture interfaces for brain wave sleep monitors on your telephone. As Hal Varian has pointed out, we are in one of those unusual combinatorial periods in history where technology offers us a rich set of recombinable components that have been perfected but not yet incorporated into the fabric of society. Furthermore, significant innovations can now be done by smaller teams at more rapid rates and lower cost than before. In fact, the technology has allowed the rise of a digital culture of DIY hobbyists, exemplified by the Maker, Instructables, and Quantified Self Movements, who emphasize exploring the newly possible and just-in-time self-education, There are at least two interesting implications for HCI, I think. First is that we are in a new golden age for HCI, like the heady days when the GUI was being invented. New I/O devices are needed, new major interaction paradigms are possible, and CHI conferences should become more interesting. Second, the state of current technology and the spirit of the Maker Movement suggest a means for making progress on one of HCI’s oldest structural problems: how to ground the field, accelerate its progress, and make it cumulative by fashioning theories and incorporating them into practice. It is this latter point on which I wish to dwell. In this talk, I will attempt to sketch out, in the spirit of the times, what an interaction science for HCI could look like, how it might be incorporated into practice, and how it might be taught. \  \ BIO: Stuart Card works on the theory and design of human machine systems. Until his retirement, he was a Senior Research Fellow at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and head of its User Interface Research group. His study of input devices led to the Fitts's Law characterization of the mouse and was a major factor leading to the mouse's commercial introduction by Xerox. His group developed theoretical characterizations of human-machine interaction, including the Model Human Processor, the GOMS theory of user interaction, information foraging theory, theories of the sensemaking process of knowledge aggregation, developments in information visualization, and statistical characterizations of Internet use. The work of his group has resulted in a dozen Xerox products and contributed to the founding of three software companies, \  \ Card is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the recipient of the 2007 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science for fundamental contributions of the fields of human-computer interaction and information visualization. He is an ACM Fellow, the recipient of the ACM Computer-Human Interaction Lifetime Achievement Award, IEEE VGTC Visualization Career Award, and a member of the CHI-Academy. Card received an A.B. degree in physics from Oberlin College and a Ph.D. degree in psychology from Carnegie Mellon University. He holds 50 patents and has published 90 papers and three books.

This is particularly critical now in the US. Many of these prototype product ideas are quite good, but never see the light of day. At different times and within alternate companies they later become excellent products. There are many factors that contribute to good ideas apparently 'failing' to be released. Rarely are there papers or discussions held to dissect what factors led to their apparent rejection. Companies often repeat innovation mistakes, without benefitting from the hindsight from others. I will illustrate many media based products I have been involved with and were left on the shelf, only to come to life later. Although innovative enough, I will share the insights that probably led them not to come to market. \  \ BIO: S. Joy Mountford is currently a consultant to eBay on the future of ecommerce. Through her long career in human-computer interaction she has been an internationally recognized leader in the field. She has designed and led teams designing a wide variety of systems.

Moreover, our tools, interactions, and infrastructures are tied intimately to human flourishing. In this SIGCHI Social Impact Award talk, I seek to inspire the CHI community to engage with socially significant issues. This talk will be a combination of personal reflections on building theory and method over a 20-year period, and a synthesis of core framings in value sensitive design. Along the way, I will dwell on method, examining roughly a dozen value sensitive design methods that taken as a whole can help researchers and designers account for human values in their technical endeavors. In so doing, I will expand the HCI design space beyond technical devices to infrastructure, policy, and social norms. Key to my discussion will be attention to the challenges of scale – across time, geography, cultures, and stakeholders. From method, I will make the turn to multi-lifespan information system design and concentrate my talk on the first project under that program – the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal which supports peace-building and reconciliation in the aftermath of widespread violence. I will close this talk with openings: open questions in value sensitive and multi-lifespan information system design; and, more broadly, open challenges for the HCI community as we imagine the tools, interactions, and infrastructures that will underlie the futures of societies. We set our sights on progress, not perfection. \  \ Biography Batya Friedman is a Professor in the Information School, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington where she directs the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab. Batya pioneered value sensitive design (VSD), an approach to account for human values in the design of information systems. First developed in human-computer interaction, VSD has since been used in information management, human-robotic interaction, computer security, civil engineering, applied philosophy, and land use and transportation. Her work has focused on a wide range of values, some include privacy in public, trust, freedom from bias, moral agency, sustainability, safety, calmness, freedom of expression, and human dignity; along with a range of technologies such as web browsers, urban simulation, robotics, open source tools, mobile computing, implantable medical devices, computer security, ubiquitous computing and computing infrastructure. She is currently working on multi-lifespan information system design and on methods for envisioning – new ideas for leveraging information systems to shape our futures. Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal is an early project in this multi-lifespan information system design program. Batya received both her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.","","","","sp0110-file2.jpg","","","Batya Friedman","batya@uw.edu","","","","Feb 20 19:29",""

How will we invent the next medium for interactive expression? \  \ BIO: Dan Olsen Jr. is a Professor of Computer Science at Brigham Young University and was the first director of the CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. He is one of the earliest and most influential researchers in the user interface software domain. His first contributions were in using formal language techniques (such as finite state machines and Backus-Naur Form) to specify the syntactic structure of a user interface. He has published three books on user interface software: “Building Interactive Systems: Principles for Human-Computer Interaction,” “Developing User Interfaces,” and “User Interface Management Systems: Models and Algorithms.” His 1988 MIKE system was an early and influential system for automatically generating a user interface from semantic specifications. Dan has continued to make important research contributions and novel systems in a wide variety of areas, from CSCW to Interactive Machine Learning, and developing Metrics and Principles for Human-Robot Interaction. Dan has also received CHI's Lifetime Service Award for his many years of service on behalf of the SIGCHI community. He was the founding editor of TOCHI, and played a key role in establishing the UIST conference and in making it one of the most successful SIGCHI conferences.","","","","","","","Dan Olsen, Jr.","olsen@cs.byu.edu","","","","Feb  7 16:47",""

When well-designed and properly customized for an individual, these devices not only traverse physical limitations but also become very much a part of the wearer's physical self. Critical to this effort is the understanding of how humans interact with their own limbs, and the development of actuator technologies and control methodologies that interact with the human in manner compatible with their natural interaction. In this lecture, I present several examples of prosthethic limbs and orthotic devices designed to support comfortable and efficient use, highly precise control, and ease of use. These examples are then used to motivate design strategies for prosthetic and orthotic devices. \  \ Bio: Hugh Herr is Associate Professor within MIT's Program of Media Arts and Sciences, and The Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. His primary research objective is to apply principles of biomechanics and neural control to guide the designs of wearable robotic systems for human rehabilitation and physical augmentation. In the area of human augmentation, Professor Herr has employed cross bridge models of skeletal muscle to the design and optimization of a new class of human-powered mechanisms that amplify endurance for cyclic anaerobic activities. He has also built elastic shoes that increase metabolic economy for running, and leg exoskeletons for walking load-carrying augmentation. In the area of assistive technology, Professor Herr’s group has developed powered orthotic and prosthetic mechanisms for use as assistive interventions in the treatment of leg disabilities caused by amputation, stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Professor Herr has authored or coauthored over 60 technical publications in biomechanics and wearable robotics. He was the recipient of the 2007 Heinz Award for Technology, Economy, and Employment.","","","","sp0113-file2.jpg","","","Hugh Herr","hherr@media.mit.edu","","","","Feb 10 17:59",""
