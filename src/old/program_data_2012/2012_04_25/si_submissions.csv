Thus, for CHI2013 we are planning a new venue, where replicated studies can be submitted, presented, and discussed. For CHI2012, we propose a SIG to discuss the preparations for how RepliCHI will work in its first year.

Participatory work has been performed with very different intentions: to democratize the design process; to better inform the design of new systems; to engage the public in the construction of their own futures; or simply to appease funding commitments. Whilst this increased attention has lead to a large amount of methodological innovation, very little effort has been spent reflecting on why various participatory approaches should, or should not be, used and how we can assess their impacts on the design process and products. This invited SIG will bring together invited experts who have explored participation to different degrees within their past work to provoke group and plenary audience discussion.

We start by looking at critiques of standard approaches to evaluation in HCI. We then look at approaches, which have been developed in Digital Art to merge qualitative and quantitative methods. These investigations set the agenda for the SIG with the aim of uncovering the audience’s knowledge and attempts at Digital Art evaluation, appreciation and critique. The chief outcome will be an exchange of experiences and proposals for ways forward for both the Digital Arts community and the broader CHI community.","1.
