Statistics for digital music sales, streaming video videos, computer games, and illegal sharing all speak of a huge interest. At the same, an incredible amount of data about every day interactions (sales and use) with music is accumulating through new cloud services. However, there is an amazing lack of public knowledge about everyday music interaction. This panel discusses the state of music interaction as a part of digital media research. We consider why music interaction research has become so marginal in HCI and discuss how to revive it. Our two discussion themes are: orientation towards design vs. research in music related R&D, and the question if and how private, big data on music interactions could enlighten our understanding of ubiquitous media culture.","[1]	http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/04/apple-has-sold-300m-ipods-currently-holds-78-of-the-music-player-market/. \ [2]	http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/092911funding \ [3]	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/30/spotify-facebook-privacy_n_988716.html \ [4]	http://www.mobilemusicworkshop.org/07/ \ [5]	Bentley, F., Metcalf, C. and Harboe, G.

Specifically, we consider theoretical, critical and practical approaches to material interactions and how they inform/become useful to HCI. The panel will include position statements from the panelists as well as high-level audience participation. We envision a fun and intellectually stimulating panel moderated by Prof. Mikael Wiberg consisting of a number of scholars with a well-developed view on digital materialities to fuel a discussion on material interactions - from atoms & bits to entangled practices.

In order to do so we made two principal changes: \  \ 1) We replace Jon Kolko with Alicia Gibb. This will help the panel focus principally on the practices of young entrepreneurs who are doing independent research and development. \  \ 2) We placed more emphasis on giving audience members a practical how-to/to-do list.

The breadth increase can be seen in the increasingly broad understanding of stakeholders and long-term socio-cultural-environmental consequences of interactive technologies. The depth increase can be seen in the seriousness with which HCI takes complex, subjective dimensions of interaction, such as affect, identity, experience, aesthetics. Humanistic forms of scholarship, including theories, methodologies, and scholarly forms, have increasingly been used to address many of these breadth and depth issues. In this panel, we explore the state of the art of humanist scholarship in HCI and consider its future trajectories. ","1. Bardzell, J. 2009. Interaction criticism and aesthetics.
