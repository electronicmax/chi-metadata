Drawing on emerging critical perspectives, the workshop will address visual literacy and visual thinking from an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary design-orientation [2, 8], foregrounding the notion that imagery is a primary form of visual thinking. Imagery—which subsumes digital imagery—goes well beyond sketching and beyond storyboards, screenshots and wireframes. We will address how a broader framework for visual thinking and imagery in HCI can play a role in raising the visual standards of HCI research and practice. Workshop participants will investigate possibilities for developing a culture of curatorial gaze in HCI, in order to (i) promote collection of digital images as a method appropriate for a design-oriented discipline, (ii) invite others to contribute to a genre of working and corpus of imagery unique to HCI, and (iii) to expand the approaches that design-oriented HCI may productively and creatively draw upon.

wo114,design,A Contextualised Curriculum for HCI,Sally,Fincher,"Sally Fincher, Paul Cairns, Alan Blackwell",,"Food and interaction design presents an interesting challenge to the HCI community in attending to the pervasive nature of food, the socio-cultural differences in food practices and a changing global foodscape. To design for meaningful and positive interactions it is essential to identify daily food practices and the opportunities for the design of technology to support such practices. This workshop brings together a community of researchers and practitioners in human-food interaction to attend to the practical and theoretical difficulties in designing for human-food interactions in everyday life. Through a practical field study and workshop we explore themes of food experiences, health and wellbeing, sustainability and alternative food cultures."

African youth are on the frontline in bringing about socio-economic transformation in the continent and need to be empowered to be able to positively play their part. The huge gaps between education policies and practice and problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers.

to121,,Conceptualizing and advancing research networking systems,Titus,Schleyer,"Titus Schleyer, Brian Butler, Mei Song, Heiko Spallek","Science in general, and biomedical research in particular, is becoming more collaborative. As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose “research networking systems” (RNS) as a new type  of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas: Foundations, Presentation, Architecture and Evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers’ need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators’ desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple  sources, social system interoperability,  and integration with the user’s primary work context. Lastly,  Evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods. We hope that this paper stimulates the human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work and related communities to pursue a broad and comprehensive agenda for developing research networking systems"
wo148,design,"Cool aX Continents, Cultures and Communities",Daniel,Fitton,"Janet Read, Daniel Fitton, Linda Little, Matthew Horton",,"Increasingly products need to be ‘cool’, ‘wow’, fun, rather than merely being 'functional' in order to appeal to consumers. Product innovation then turns into not only working out how to apply technologies to realize some useful product function, but also in how to create an appealing and alluring experience. The core question one would like to see answered already early on in the development process is, of course, how we can make sure that the final product is going to be fun, pleasurable, appealing (in addition to being functional and usable). However, when looking at the literature, no real, concrete, hands-on answers are popping up yet. On the other hand, in industry and academia much tacit knowledge and experience must exist, about what worked before and what not. Analyzing systematically successful product introductions, tapping into that tacit knowledge, may help to derive heuristics that can support new product and service development, and aid in a better understanding of this elusive concept."

However, current user interfaces (UIs) often lack adequate support for 3D interactions: 2D metaphors still dominate in GUI design, 2D desktop systems are often limited in cases where natural interaction with 3D content is required, and sophisticated 3D user interfaces consisting of stereoscopic projections and tracked input devices are rarely adopted by ordinary users. In the future, novel interaction design solutions are needed to better support the natural interaction and utilize the special features of 3D technologies. \  \ In this workshop we address the research and industrial challenges involved in exploring the space where the flat digital world of surface computing meets the physical, spatially complex, 3D space in which we live. The workshop will provide a common forum for researchers to \ share their visions of the future and recent results in the area of improving 3D interaction and UI design. "

Without this knowledge, we cannot build tools to adequately support their needs. This paper reports the results of a detailed qualitative empirical study of end-user programmers’ sensemaking about a spreadsheet’s correctness. Using our study’s data, we derived a sensemaking model for end-user debugging and categorized participants’ activities and verbalizations according to this model, allowing us to investigate how participants went about debugging. Among the results are identification of the prevalence of information foraging during end-user debugging, two successful strategies for traversing the sensemaking model, potential ties to gender differences in the literature, sensemaking sequences leading to debugging progress, and sequences tied with troublesome points in the debugging process. The results also reveal new implications for the design of spreadsheet tools to support end-user programmers’ sensemaking during debugging.",,,Contributes a sensemaking model for end-user debugging and new insights into debugging strategies and behaviors.

Whilst the theoretical foundations for UX research are not yet established, those responses can serve as candidate resources for setting the theoretical directions. A primary conclusion from the SIG discussion is that the CHI community needs theories in UX research and practice. A major contribution of the workshop will be to clarify the applicability and transferability of different theories, theoretical foundations, concepts in informing UX design and evaluation in both research and practice. In particular we will look into theories that have already been applied in practice."

Combining Physiology with Observation in User Studies,Ioannis,Pavlidis,"avinash wesley, Peggy Lindner, Ioannis Pavlidis","Emotion and Affective User Interface; Empirical Methods, Quantitative; Empirical Methods, Qualitative","In this article the authors describe a novel way to conduct user studies via the combination of a physiological and an observational information channel. The method enables not only the quantification of arousing emotional states but also their disambiguation into positive or negative instances. The physiological channel targets sympathetic responses and is materialized as a perspiratory signal extracted from thermal imagery of the perinasal area. The observational channel is materialized via decoding of facial expressions. However, while such decoding is usually performed in the visible spectrum, the authors have developed an algorithm to carry this out in thermal imagery instead. Thus, thermal imaging is used for both physiological and observational analysis. The potential of this dual unobtrusive methodology is demonstrated with some examples from a stress study, where users (surgeons in this case) interact with laparoscopic training boxes. \ ",,,Method
to116,,Evaluating and Understanding the Usability of a Pen-based Command System for Interactive Paper,Chunyuan,Liao,"Chunyuan Liao, François Guimbretière","To combine the affordance of paper and computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? \  \ To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface \ supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction.",,,User studies on a pen-gesture-based interactive paper system for Active Reading.

In contrast, we used predictive human performance modeling in a collaborative, distributed mode and reflect on that experience. We discovered that our tool for modeling, CogTool, while sufficiently functional and expressive to perform the modeling task, did not support collaborative, distributed modeling as well as we would like.  We suggest process improvements in model construction, the management of assumptions, consistency, and communication, and suggest design solutions for the future of CogTool or other modeling tools.

However, it is not sufficiently investigated how the tele-operated humanoid robots can affect and be accepted by people in a real world. In the present study, we investigated how elementary school children accepted Telenoid R1, a tele-operated humanoid robot. We conducted a school-based action research project to explore their responses to the robot. Our research theme was the social aspects that might facilitate communication and the purpose was problem finding. There have been considerable studies for resolving the remote disadvantage; although face-to-face is always supposed to be the best way for our communication, we ask whether it is possible to determine the primacy of remote communication over face-to-face. As a result of the field experiment in a school, the structure of children’s group work changed and their attitude turned more positive than usual. Their spontaneity was brought out and role differentiation occurred with them. Mainly due to the limitations by Telenoid, children changed their attitude and could cooperatively work. The result suggested that the remote communication that set a limit to our capability could be useful for us to know and be trained the effective way to work more cooperatively than usual face-to-face.

Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies.",,,Proposed multitasking metrics to establish a conceptual foundation for future multitasking studies. Understanding the extent to which multitasking occurs can assist designers in improving applications that are used simultaneously.

We identify three mechanisms potentially accounting for the \ success of such interfaces: high levels of awareness of others, high levels of control \ over interface and high levels of transparency of background information. We \ challenge the idea that interaction over such interfaces is necessarily ‘natural’ and \ argue that everyday interaction involves constraints on awareness, control and \ transparency. These constraints support smoother interaction. We present a \ framework characterizing the design of multi-user interfaces in terms of how \ constraints can be best used to promote collaboration, based on how these \ mechanisms support transparent and salient interactions. We use this framework first \ to explain successes and failures of existing designs, then apply it to three case \ studies, and finally derive criteria for use in designing multi-user interfaces for \ collaboration.",,,Comprehensive conceptual framework for considering design and evaluation dimensions for how multi-user interfaces can best support collaboration in work and play across the range of users.

It consists of a time- series of stacked tag clouds consisting of the (interesting) words in tweets that match a topic. Sizes of words are pro- portional to their frequency; words are also colored accord- ing to the emotional content of the tweet. So, for example, if several people tweet “I love my Nokia N900”, then “N900” will show up colored bright blue, because it’s in the same tweet as the word “love”, which the system recognizes as positive. In addition to understanding topics of corporate in- terest (“Nokia”, “N8”, etc.), Nokia Internet Pulse is also useful for understanding buzz around individuals (“Rihanna”), con- ferences (“mobilehci”), topics (“rumor OR rumors”), Twitter- specific phenomena (“RT”) and more. Clicking on words shows a list of tweets that contain those words, allowing easy drill-down to view individual tweets.

When societies experience disruption as caused by  natural disasters, various official government agencies, relief organizations, and emergent citizen groups aid in the recovery effort—where normal societal function resumes. In war environments however, societal trust can be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated individuals that provide and repair infrastructure. We show how citizens used ICTs to repair infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by conflict by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure, as well as implications for the disaster relief effort."

For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher’s stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen which mimics the teacher’s stylus movement; (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen.  \ McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig’s effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig – they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems. \ ",,,"McSig is a multimodal system for teaching blind children to write and draw.

The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations.  Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown the possibility to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of socio-cognitive aspects.  Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance.  The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semi-structured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain.  Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups: information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness.  Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments.

This paper will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogues between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study.  In the experiments discussed in this paper, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication.  To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however each had to control a robot based on the user’s instructions.  While many monologue-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogues highlights a more complex pattern of results.  As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication.  However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction – the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower) – that has the most significant impact.  In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male ‘robots’/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks.  Moreover, dialogue-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female ‘robots’/followers achieved successful communication through ‘alignment’ of spatial descriptions.  In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female ‘robots’/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings).  This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female ‘disadvantage’ in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms.  Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender.  ",,,Describes gender differences in spatial communication and navigation in Human-Robot Interaction. Presents a novel methodology and design recommendations for dialogue and navigating systems that equally support users of both genders.

Prior educational approaches have not successfully addressed these critical skills. The assumption has been that the highest fidelity simulations result in the best learning. Deploying high-fidelity simulations is expensive and dangerous; they do not address team coordination. Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. \  \ Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination. We synthesize the sustained iterative design and evaluation of the Team Coordination Game. We develop and apply new experimental methods to show that participants learn to cooperate and communicate, applying what they learn in practice.

However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of “publics,” drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities. Implications that can be drawn from this work concern the role of digital media creation and sharing for the formation of collectives and how people position themselves collectively in relation to larger social groups and societal norms. The analysis suggests fruitful crossovers among HCI, Media Theory and New Media Research by approaching the user as both consumer and producer of digital content.",,,This paper proposes “publics” from media theory to stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of participation.

We present two new two-handed multistroke marking menu variants in which users either draw strokes with both hands simultaneously or alternate strokes between hands. In a pair of studies we find that using two hands simultaneously is faster than using a single, dominant-handed marking menu by 10-15%. Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions. For two-handed simultaneous menus, stroke pairs that are bilaterally symmetric or share the same direction are fastest. We conclude with design guidelines and sample applications to aid multitouch application developers interested in using one- and two-handed marking menus.",,,Describes two-handed marking menu techniques.

We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity.

Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding. However, they tend to focus only on the virtual side of sociality, and downplay the role of physicality in social interaction. In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging.  Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise.  However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions.",,,Exploratory

[Margolin 2005] \  \ In interface design, defamiliarization can be used to bring users’ attention to the interface itself because of a temporary lack of fulfilment of expectations [Peterson, M.G., Iversen, O.S., Krogh, G.P 2004; Sengers, Gaver 2006]. This concept is particularly promising for the user interface in the context of ‘radical’ innovation: it can be used as a tool to facilitate the uptake of such innovation, by serving as a source of delight for the user in the user experience. \ Radical innovation presents substantial obstacles both to usability and to usability testing [Rogers, Y. Rutherford, A. Bibby, P. 1992]: such innovation stops users in their tracks by intentionally frustrating expectations. Defamiliarization, as some recent research has argued, can respond to this problem by causing users to step back from the process they are engaged in (i.e., trying to engage with an interface) to experience features of the interface itself, and to gain pleasure and fun from that interaction [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005]. In the course of that step back, the innovative feature is discovered, and the user re-enters the primary process of ‘working with’ the interface. \  \ A handful of designers are incorporating defamiliarization into their design strategies [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005; Sengers, Gaver, 2006]. For instance, at Canonical, a major part of our design work on the Ubuntu operating system is concerned with ‘radical’ innovation. We have substantial experience with such innovation threatening usability as it challenges conventions and habits. We have begun to employ defamiliarized user journeys as a facilitator of usability. There are two major aspects of this work: \  \ 1.Creating defamiliarized experiences that bring attention to the technology itself without introducing usability challenges, thereby supporting discovery; \ 2.Evaluating defamiliarization. A central question for us is: how can we assess this technique as part of usability testing and qualitative feedback? \  \ As the literature evidences, there are many ways to use defamiliarization in design: \ •	juxtaposing incongruities \ •	creating unexpected contexts \ •	exaggerating information \ •	providing minimal representations \ •	creating ambiguity \ •	using extreme characters \  \ There are other methods that practitioners have not recognised but that they may use implicitly. \  \ Workshop Goals  \  \ Clarify ways defamiliarization can be successfully applied to interface design to create compelling experiences;  \ Determine the reach and usefulness of defamiliarization for innovation; \ Explore techniques that enhance the role defamiliarization can play in ease of use -- bridging, cues, etc; \ Define user testing approaches to assess the success of defamiliarization efforts. \ "

In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants’ cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants’ navigational performance.
