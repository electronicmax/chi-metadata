Designs that facilitate behaviors like positive interdependence, group processing and social skills such as turn taking are discussed. We report qualitative observations regarding the effectiveness of the proposed interaction designs in trials involving two groups of children with contrasting psychological safety levels and formulated several generalizable design patterns that were observed to be effective in soliciting collaborative play on interactive tabletops.","1.

We also responded to the reviewers' requests for more on Suchmans' ""capacities for action"" and more specific implications for design that could be followed.  As a result, the examples remain constant but the analytical thrust of the paper has changed to explore the question of ""values in design"" as a property of designerly choices about the distribution of agency within a system.

Addressing a central problem of qualitative research on MMOGs - how to document the activities of players’ domestic, everyday/everynight play practices - we describe how the virtual ‘travelogue’ allows participants to share, and annotate, screenshots of their MMOG play. Based on our preliminary analysis of 69 travelogues, we explore how these texts function similar to travel postcards, as generic images of in-game events and environments that are personalized and narrativized through players’ annotations. We also discuss two themes across the travelogues, (in)authenticity and individualization, that illuminate the ways players negotiate the standardizing effect of many MMOG play experiences.","WARNING: Reference 5 is very long.

In this work, we provide a critical interpretative account of the experience of using a sexually oriented social media website called I Just Made Love. We do this by critically interpreting the traces of interaction, user data populating the site, to understand the role of the systemic structures that shape the subject of interaction and in turn the experience. We approach this experience from the perspective of the “subject of interaction” as opposed to the “user” and introduce some benefits of such a strategy. Through our insights and discussion, we explore how design choices at IJML contribute to certain types of sexual performances and intimate experiences.","1. Bardzell, J.

A goal of the design is to extend the typical contexts of automotive user-interface design by (1) looking inward to the imagined “character” of the car and (2) looking outward to the larger social context that surrounds driving. We deploy storytelling and theatrical strategies as a way of moving our thinking outside the familiar constraints of automotive design. These methods help us to extend the concept of a lifelog to consider the “lives” of objects and the relationship between humans and non-humans as fruitful areas of design research.","1.

Three words: ‘drawing’, ‘thing’ and ‘together’, are at the center of our discourse. We propose a view of design as accessing, aligning, and navigating among the “constituents” of the object of design. People interact with the object of design through its constituents. The object of design is to draw things together.","WARNING: Reference 9 is very long.  Please check it. \  \ 1. A.Telier, T. Binder, T, G. de Michelis, P. Ehn, P. Linde, G. Jacucci and I.

Mischievous activity pushes the boundaries of the implicit social contract present in all online social systems, and, we argue, is of vital importance understanding online social interactions. Using examples from games and other applications, we explore mischief as an act of appropriation, which reinterprets mechanics defined by developers in unexpected and sometimes upsetting ways. Although frequently interpreted as negative and anti-social behaviour, we argue that mischief serves a vital social role, and find surprising richness in the chaos.","1. Bakioglu, B.

These techniques may engage expertise from different disciplines, and potentially increase productivity. This paper presents a model of massively distributed collaborative authorship of academic papers. This model, developed by a collective of thirty authors, identifies key tools and techniques that would be necessary or useful to the writing process. The process of collaboratively writing this paper was used to discover, negotiate, and document issues in massively authored scholarship.

This makes it relevant to gain an understanding of how and why movements communicate attributes related to agency and what impact it has on users. This paper describes an experiment in which users, alone or in pairs, interact with a TV designed to move in way that communicates the agency related attributes social status or likeability. Results show that the TV movements are perceived differently when one versus two users are present. While most single users evaluate the TV positively, most users in pairs find the differential treatment problematic. ","1. Abramovitch, R.

The device prompts wearers to move in strange ways, bypassing norms of self-constraint, to actuate sound. As the wearer bends and twists their torso, causing the disks to touch, a single tone may be triggered through the integrated speakers. The result is sonically and physically ungainly, yet strangely compelling, and often prompts spontaneous laughter. hipDisk emerged from an embodied, performative research approach. It began as a single user device, and evolved to support social interaction and co-creation, as well as creatively engaged, embodied discovery and learning. The focus in this paper is on the third, participatory, phase of the project, and the value of emergent, performative research.","1.
