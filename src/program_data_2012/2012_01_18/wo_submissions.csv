Whilst the theoretical foundations for UX research are not yet established, those responses can serve as candidate resources for setting the theoretical directions. A primary conclusion from the SIG discussion is that the CHI community needs theories in UX research and practice. A major contribution of the workshop will be to clarify the applicability and transferability of different theories, theoretical foundations, concepts in informing UX design and evaluation in both research and practice. In particular we will look into theories that have already been applied in practice.","[1]	Blythe, M., Wright, P., McCarthy, J. and Bertelsen, O.W. 2006.

However, current user interfaces (UIs) often lack adequate support for 3D interactions: 2D metaphors still dominate in GUI design, 2D desktop systems are often limited in cases where natural interaction with 3D content is required, and sophisticated 3D user interfaces consisting of stereoscopic projections and tracked input devices are rarely adopted by ordinary users. In the future, novel interaction design solutions are needed to better support the natural interaction and utilize the special features of 3D technologies. \  \ In this workshop we address the research and industrial challenges involved in exploring the space where the flat digital world of surface computing meets the physical, spatially complex, 3D space in which we live. The workshop will provide a common forum for researchers to \ share their visions of the future and recent results in the area of improving 3D interaction and UI design.

This workshop extends current thinking about identity toward performative aspects: how self and identity is constituted, how this relates to digital technology, and what this means for design and use of such technology. As technology’s growth in domestic, social and intimate contexts suggests a new consideration of how identity is invoked, we propose to examine philosophical commitments, methodological implications, and pragmatic aspects of putting performativity to work, identifying blind spots and obstacles that hamper research and practice in this area. And we use hands-on critique, panel discussion and brief presentations, to explore how HCI can respond to the challenge of who we are and what we might become in our pursuit of digitally mediated futures.","[1]	Bardzell, J., Bardzell, S.

[Margolin 2005] \  \ In interface design, defamiliarization can be used to bring users’ attention to the interface itself because of a temporary lack of fulfilment of expectations [Peterson, M.G., Iversen, O.S., Krogh, G.P 2004; Sengers, Gaver 2006]. This concept is particularly promising for the user interface in the context of ‘radical’ innovation: it can be used as a tool to facilitate the uptake of such innovation, by serving as a source of delight for the user in the user experience. \ Radical innovation presents substantial obstacles both to usability and to usability testing [Rogers, Y. Rutherford, A. Bibby, P. 1992]: such innovation stops users in their tracks by intentionally frustrating expectations. Defamiliarization, as some recent research has argued, can respond to this problem by causing users to step back from the process they are engaged in (i.e., trying to engage with an interface) to experience features of the interface itself, and to gain pleasure and fun from that interaction [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005]. In the course of that step back, the innovative feature is discovered, and the user re-enters the primary process of ‘working with’ the interface. \  \ A handful of designers are incorporating defamiliarization into their design strategies [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005; Sengers, Gaver, 2006]. For instance, at Canonical, a major part of our design work on the Ubuntu operating system is concerned with ‘radical’ innovation. We have substantial experience with such innovation threatening usability as it challenges conventions and habits. We have begun to employ defamiliarized user journeys as a facilitator of usability. There are two major aspects of this work: \  \ 1.Creating defamiliarized experiences that bring attention to the technology itself without introducing usability challenges, thereby supporting discovery; \ 2.Evaluating defamiliarization. A central question for us is: how can we assess this technique as part of usability testing and qualitative feedback? \  \ As the literature evidences, there are many ways to use defamiliarization in design: \ •	juxtaposing incongruities \ •	creating unexpected contexts \ •	exaggerating information \ •	providing minimal representations \ •	creating ambiguity \ •	using extreme characters \  \ There are other methods that practitioners have not recognised but that they may use implicitly. \  \ Workshop Goals  \  \ Clarify ways defamiliarization can be successfully applied to interface design to create compelling experiences;  \ Determine the reach and usefulness of defamiliarization for innovation; \ Explore techniques that enhance the role defamiliarization can play in ease of use -- bridging, cues, etc; \ Define user testing approaches to assess the success of defamiliarization efforts. \ ","[1] Aoki, P. & Woodruff, A.

The workshop will explore task and context modeling issues of capture, representation, exchange, standardization and interoperability, encountered in creating context-aware and activity-based assistive tools for supporting knowledge work in next generation digital workspaces. Exploration of solutions of these outstanding problems will lay the groundwork for smart digital workspaces that “know” what the user is doing (activity structure, context, goals), how are they doing it (methods), what resources are they using (allocation and discovery), when (time) and where (location, application, device) are they doing it, who are they (profile, history), what is their role (responsibility, security, privacy) and who are their collaborators (social network), all the while observing, recording this context of work (institutional tribal knowledge). These smart workspaces to be developed in the next five years, will let the users seamlessly move between applications and devices without having to remember or copy what they did earlier (activity context transfer and exchange), proactively show them steps others took in meaningfully similar situations before (semantic task reasoning), quickly find and show them directly related information and present answers to questions based on what they mean (proactive semantic extraction and search), in the context they need it, with access to provenance, quality and derivation of information, connect them to insights of experts within the organization and beyond, helping them reason and decide faster, with greater confidence, within a framework for managing, semantically dividing, tracking and enabling distributed work.

Drawing on emerging critical perspectives, the workshop will address visual literacy and visual thinking from an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary design-orientation [2, 8], foregrounding the notion that imagery is a primary form of visual thinking. Imagery—which subsumes digital imagery—goes well beyond sketching and beyond storyboards, screenshots and wireframes. We will address how a broader framework for visual thinking and imagery in HCI can play a role in raising the visual standards of HCI research and practice. Workshop participants will investigate possibilities for developing a culture of curatorial gaze in HCI, in order to (i) promote collection of digital images as a method appropriate for a design-oriented discipline, (ii) invite others to contribute to a genre of working and corpus of imagery unique to HCI, and (iii) to expand the approaches that design-oriented HCI may productively and creatively draw upon.

Product innovation then turns into not only working out how to apply technologies to realize some useful product function, but also in how to create an appealing and alluring experience. The core question one would like to see answered already early on in the development process is, of course, how we can make sure that the final product is going to be fun, pleasurable, appealing (in addition to being functional and usable). However, when looking at the literature, no real, concrete, hands-on answers are popping up yet. On the other hand, in industry and academia much tacit knowledge and experience must exist, about what worked before and what not. Analyzing systematically successful product introductions, tapping into that tacit knowledge, may help to derive heuristics that can support new product and service development, and aid in a better understanding of this elusive concept.","[1]Engage.

Educational interfaces and software are needed to ensure that new technologies serve a clear purpose in the classrooms and homes of the future.  \  \ Since teachers are always looking for creative ways to engage 21st century learners there needs to be an academic venue for researchers to discuss novel educational tools and their role in improving learning outcomes. This workshop aims at filling this void: combining the pedagogical expertise of the cooperative learning, and learning sciences communities with the technical creativity of the CHI, UIST and interactive surface communities. The objective of this workshop is to become a conference within two years. \ ","[1]	Adams (2010) The Real Life Social Network v2.

Improving self-understanding can foster self-insight and promote positive behaviors: healthy living, energy conservation, etc. The development of personal informatics applications poses new challenges for human-computer interaction and creates opportunities for applications in various domains related to quality of life, such as fitness, nutrition, wellness, mental health, and sustainability. This workshop will continue the conversations from the CHI 2010 and CHI 2011 workshops on personal informatics [6][7]. The focal themes for this workshop are: (1) practical lessons from previous research and development experiences that can guide interface design for systems that allow users to collect and reflect on personal data; (2) requirements for building robust personal informatics applications; and (3) design and development of infrastructures that make personal informatics applications easier to create and evaluate.
