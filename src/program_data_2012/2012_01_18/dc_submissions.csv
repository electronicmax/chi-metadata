With Imaginary Interfaces we re-enable spatial interaction on screenless devices. Users point and draw in the empty space in front of them or on the palm of their hands. While they cannot see the results of their interaction, they do obtain some visual feedback by watching their hands move. Our user studies show that Imaginary Interfaces allow users to create simple drawings, to annotate with them and to operate interfaces, as long as their layout mimics a physical device they have used before. We demonstrate how this allows an imaginary interface to serve as a shortcut for a physical device and we believe that ultimately Imaginary Interfaces will lead to the development of standalone ultra-mobile devices.","[1]	Apple. iPhone VoiceOver http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision.html \ [2]	Gustafson, S., Baudisch, P., Gutwin, C.,and Irani, P.

This can be achieved through finger-worn sensors that track their movements. I am particular interested in finger gestures that are feasible while grasping devices. Executing gestures on a steering wheel while driving, such as those seen in Fig. 1, are just some examples of interactions, which would not require any device-release. The resulting question is: To what extent can users interact with grasped objects through tiny microgestures that are performed while grasping? This extended abstract shows the progress of my research and presents the design of a study that is in preparation. Around this study design I formulated research questions. My approach aims to apply motor and mental models for designing interactions and interfaces regarding human motor abilities, interaction favors, and the mental model of themselves within their environment.","[1]	Ashbrook, D., Baudisch, P., White, S.

By studying cherished physical and digital possessions and designing novel products or systems, this PhD explores how digital media can become more cherished. More specifically, newly created designs will aim to integrate physical and digital realms and encourage novel creation or augmentation of digital media, here called digital craft, as a promising means to increase attachment to digital possessions.","[1]	Bell, G., and Gemmell, J.
