UX professionals who work with Agile teams find that Agile approaches create roadblocks to their participation. Minimal up-front planning means there’s no time for user research or UX design; short sprints leave little time for considered interface design; and sprint reviews leave no place for usability testing or other validation of the sprint’s work. UX designers find that their old role relationships and procedures no longer work, their skills and techniques devalued, and there’s no clear guidance on how to contribute. \  \ But, looking at their base principles, Agile methods should be friendly to UX participation. Continuous user feedback is core to Agile—and who better to supply it than UX designers? But many Agile values and attitudes work against the needs of UX design. Agile methods were created by developers, for developers, without much consideration for user interaction. \  \ In this course, we arm UX designers with concepts and techniques enabling them to participate effectively in Agile projects. We show why Agile methods make sense from the developers’ point of view—and how principles driving Agile methods can be used to support UX involvement. We also show where Agile methods work against the UX goal of a coherent, consistent interface and provide strategies to accomplish a coherent design anyway. We describe proven Agile/UX best practices for integrating the two perspectives. \  \ Finally, we step back and look at project scope. Agile methods address small-scale projects—how to scale them up is debated in the Agile community. We show how to plan a user-centered Agile project of any scale, from iterative fixes to whole systems \ ","This course arms UX designers with techniques enabling them to participate in Agile projects, including how principles driving Agile can be used to support UX involvement.","","Sep 27 17:33"

It’s a business tool to clinch important deals; a “remote control” for the real world, helping us cope with daily travel delay frustrations; a “relationship appliance” to say goodnight to loved-ones when away from home; a community device to organize political demonstrations. \  \ This course is about applying interaction design approaches to the mobile arena. It provides an understanding of what makes for successful future mobile user experiences; ones that really connect with what people want, and operate in straightforward, satisfying ways.  \  \ As a practice, interaction design owes much to the long-established discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the associated usability industry. \ Interaction design, though, extends the mainstream practices. It is more about crafting the “customer experience” rather than a process that focuses on “ease-of-use”. Interaction designers have to have passion and heart: whereas usability is often seen as a privative – something you only notice when it is not there – interaction design is about making a statement. \  \ This course is about shifting the mobile design perspective away from “smart” phones, to people who are smart, creative, busy, or plain bored.

Making products and applications learnable, efficient and pleasant to use are certainly goals, but every designer dreams of creating something more —something so great that people crave it, long for it, must have it. Marketers call it “a must have”, “compelling”, or “insanely great”. But most of the rest of us just call it Cool. \  \ Over the past decades, Cool has evolved into a marketing imperative: an overarching requirement for many designs. Companies spend billions organizing to cultivate “innovation” so they can reliably create it. And a new generation, with vastly different expectations on Cool design, is coming of age. But Cool is hard to pin down—there’s no accepted way to define it, measure it, or design for it. Like glamour, it is an ineffable yet powerful quality depending on a host of subtle factors. \  \ This course presents a set of core attributes that make products and applications Cool. These design attributes emerged from an extensive cross-generational contextual research project understanding how people from ages 15 to 60 experience “cool” and its relationship to value and impact on their lives.  \  \ We present core Cool concepts based on the research, using real product and service examples to illustrate the material. We include the application of Cool concepts to productivity business applications. Attendees participate in an exercise to evaluate products they use, own and/or are designing to how Cool attributes apply and affect them. We end with an analysis of the development of key cool technologies revealing the real effort required to create cool products. We look at the problems organizations face in creating Cool, and discuss the challenges inherent in large organizations as they attempt to move toward a more innovative culture. \ ","This course presents a set of core attributes that make products and applications Cool, with illustrations from real products and services.

Products and services seeking to do so must incorporate key elements of persuasion design, also. They must provide suitable dashboards; context modeling; social network connections to friends, family, and interested communities; tips and advice; and games and competitions. By incorporating these key ingredients, more effective mobile (and associated desktop Web portals) can be designed to accomplish persuasion objectives to improve behavior in the short term and long term. User-centered design processes can carry the development process from start to finish.","The course presents four case studies about how to combine persuasion design with information design in mobile applications to change behavior regarding sustainability, health, wealth management, and story sharing.","","Nov 26 20:50"
