We take a series of questions as a joint point of departure to consider the nature and character of “material interactions” in HCI. Specifically, we consider theoretical, critical and practical approaches to material interactions and how they inform/become useful to HCI. The panel will include position statements from the panelists as well as high-level audience participation. We envision a fun and intellectually stimulating panel moderated by Prof. Mikael Wiberg consisting of a number of scholars with a well-developed view on digital materialities to fuel a discussion on material interactions - from atoms & bits to entangled practices. These scholars include: Prof. Hiroshi Ishii, Prof. Paul Dourish, Daniela Rosner, Petra Sundström, Anna Vallgårda and Tobie Kerridge.

","Art, HCI, collaboration, innovation, policy.","Word doc of extended abstract","","","This panel relates issues in HCI/arts to the larger innovation discourse in order to bring a fresh perspective to the STEM/arts divide.","Based on the initial comments of the panel chairs, we expanded our panelist lineup to include a greater range of researchers/practitioners/leaders in this domain. We also changed the format of the body of the abstract into a narrative style which better explains the roles that the panelists have taken in the evolution of initiatives that support interdisciplinary digital arts and HCI. More citations were added to incorporate the richness of discourse. The citations are also meant as a resource for readers who would like to familiarize themselves with this discourse. \  \ The chairs had requested that we change the title to better reflect the content. We have discussed it amongst ourselves, but can't come up with a better title. The panel is about parallels between HCI/arts and contemporary innovation discourse, the way that contemporary innovation discourse can illuminate some HCI/arts issues, and how considering these issues up and down the innovation discourse - policy - initiatives - programs - research - work chain can also be helpful with respect to understanding them. We are open to title suggestions or a further critique of the current title.","","H.5.m","","","","Oct  7 20:29"
