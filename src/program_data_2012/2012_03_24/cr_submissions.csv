The main discussion considers the field from three perspectives: what it takes to build usable systems; the psychology of the needed technology; and the computer science of the needed technology. Specific topics include psychologically based data, design methods and tools, user interface media and tools, and introduction to user interface architecture. In each, we will cover research, technology under development, and current application. Sources for follow-on information will be given. \  \ The intended audience is made up of professionals in computer-related fields who have not yet had a systematic exposure to the discipline of computer-human interaction, typically first-time attendees of the CHI conference.

UX professionals who work with Agile teams find that Agile approaches create roadblocks to their participation. Minimal up-front planning means there’s no time for user research or UX design; short sprints leave little time for considered interface design; and sprint reviews leave no place for usability testing or other validation of the sprint’s work. UX designers find that their old role relationships and procedures no longer work, their skills and techniques devalued, and there’s no clear guidance on how to contribute. \  \ But, looking at their base principles, Agile methods should be friendly to UX participation. Continuous user feedback is core to Agile—and who better to supply it than UX designers? But many Agile values and attitudes work against the needs of UX design. Agile methods were created by developers, for developers, without much consideration for user interaction. \  \ In this course, we arm UX designers with concepts and techniques enabling them to participate effectively in Agile projects. We show why Agile methods make sense from the developers’ point of view—and how principles driving Agile methods can be used to support UX involvement. We also show where Agile methods work against the UX goal of a coherent, consistent interface and provide strategies to accomplish a coherent design anyway. We describe proven Agile/UX best practices for integrating the two perspectives. \  \ Finally, we step back and look at project scope. Agile methods address small-scale projects—how to scale them up is debated in the Agile community. We show how to plan a user-centered Agile project of any scale, from iterative fixes to whole systems \ ","This course arms UX designers with techniques enabling them to participate in Agile projects, including how principles driving Agile can be used to support UX involvement.","","","","4","Sep 27 17:33",""

However, there are challenges to successfully integrating the two.  Issues include different mindsets, experiences, practices and goals which create a gulf between UX people and agile developers.  Meridium Inc. has partnered with Virginia Tech with the support of an NSF STTR grant to find ways to integrate UX into agile teams.  In our approach, extreme scenario-based design (XSBD), we combine elements from several agile and usability processes including XP, Scrum and scenario-based usability engineering.  It has been successfully used at Meridium in several projects.  In this course, our goal is to present our approach to integrating UX into agile as well as high level practices shared between the different integration approaches.  We will encourage critical thinking, reflection and active discussion of the issues surrounding agile UX through a group-based hands-on design activity combined with retrospectives and sharing of real-world experiences.

Instead of generating UIs from simple abstractions, transforming them from high-level models should be more attractive. \  \ This course shows how human-computer interaction can be based on discourse modeling, even without employing speech or natural language. This topic is innovative, since it treats HCI interaction design and user-interface generation on the level of human-human communication. \  \ Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (“atoms”) of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple “molecule” of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify a communicative interaction design. \  \ In this course, this modeling approach is explained in some detail, with a focus on the discourse models. Exercises both of understanding and creating such models are included as well. \  \ This course also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated user-interface generation. This is based on model-transformation rules according to the model-driven architecture. In addition, the course sketches our specialty, the automated optimization of the generated user interfaces for current Smartphones. \  \ The assumed attendee background is some interest in modeling and automated generation of user interfaces. There are no prerequisites such as knowledge about model-driven approaches or any of the results of Human Communication theories, Cognitive Science, Sociology or HCI in general. \ ","Presents an approach to modeling discourses inspired by human-human communication.

The social nature of watching video and television drives developers of both types of applications to explore the integration of successful social media like Facebook or Twitter with streaming video. Moreover, several apps are being created for smartphones and tablets, which act as a second screen that allows remotely communicating with friends while watching. These types of applications can be called social TV, allowing remote viewers to interact with each other via the television set, smartphones, tablets or the PC. Features include remote talking or chatting while watching television, sending recommendations, leaving comments, showing what you watch or sharing video clips. \  \ This course studies current developments on social television and online video applications, providing participants first hand knowledge on how to analyze, design and evaluate them. The term ‘sociability’ is used to indicate these interface aspects that support and enhance social interaction with and through new technologies and applications, and social interaction design is a way of including these sociability aspects in the design process. The specific nature of social video watching, such as enjoying a television program while communicating or using television content as conversation starter, warrant the use of a specific design process and guidelines, focusing on social interaction and sociability. \  \ During the course, participants will learn in a very practical way how to design and evaluate social features of these emergent applications.

Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas are yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition works, what are its limitations, and how it could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.","Learn how speech recognition works, what are its limitations and usability challenges, how it could be used to enhance interaction paradigms, and what is the current research and commercial state-of-the-art.","crfile136-1.odp","crfile136-2.doc","","29","Sep 30 14:29",""

When personnel change, or economies are being made in the organization the usability work can be vulnerable. \  \ The course will suggest a more structured approach to usability process improvement, by auditing the extent to which the good practice embodied in ISO TR 18529 is implemented in typical projects, and identifying areas for organizational improvement.   \  \ The course recommends use of material from ISO standards not just because they are standards, but because they contain the most comprehensive and systematic information available, which represents the consensus of international experts in the field.   \  \ Each ISO 18529 activity can be assessed as not done, partially done, largely done or fully done, as part of systems development.

Although as a class these online communities are very successful, the success of particular ones varies widely and many fail.  \  \ To become or remain successful, online communities must meet a number of challenges that are common to offline as well as online groups and organizations.  For example, online communities must handle the start-up challenge: early in their lifecycle they have few members to generate content and little content to attract members. Throughout their lifecycle, they must recruit and socialize newcomers, encourage commitment and contribution from members, solve problems of coordination and encourage appropriate behavior among members and interlopers alike. This tutorial is organized around two of these design challenges – starting a community and getting members to contribute to it. \  \ The social sciences can tell us a lot about how to make thriving online communities. Economics and various branches of psychology offer theories of individual motivation and of human behavior in social situations.  Properly interpreted, they can inform choices about how to get a community started and motivate contributions.   \  \ After taking this tutorial, students will appreciate the value of using social science research as the basis for social design. They will have had an introduction to the social science literature relevant to problems of encouraging contributions in online communities and starting a community from scratch. Through exercises, they will appreciate how to translate theory and evidence into designs.  They will have pointers to where to learn more. \  \ The tutorial is based on the presenters’ new book, Kraut & Resnick (2012). Building successful online communities: Evidence-based social design. Cambridge MA: MIT Press.

Being empathetic implies that the computer is able to recognize user’s affective states and understand the implication of those states. Automatic detection of affective states requires the computer: to sense information; to process and understand information integrating several sources that could range from brain-waves signals and biofeedback readings, passing from gestures recognition, to posture and pressure sensing; and to apply algorithms and data processing tools to understand user’s affective states. \  \ Through this course, attendees will:  \  \ a) Learn about sensing approaches used to detect affective states: brain-computer interfaces, face-based emotion recognition systems, eye-tracking system, and physiological sensors –including skin conductivity, posture, and pressure sensors—. \  \ b) Understand the pros and cons of the diverse sensing approaches used to detect affective states. \  \ c) Learn about the data that is gathered from each device and understand its characteristics. \  \ d) Learn about approaches and tools to pre-process, synchronize, and analyze data. \  \ This course is open to researchers, practitioners, and educators interested in incorporating affective computing as part of their adaptive and personalized technology toolbox. \  \ The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction with demonstrations and exercises, all aimed to help making the topic concrete, memorable, and actionable. \ ","This course presents devices and explores methodologies for multimodal detection of affective states, as well as a discussion about presenter’s experiences using them both in learning and gaming scenarios.","crfile145-1.zip","crfile145-2.docx","","30","Oct  1 01:38",""
