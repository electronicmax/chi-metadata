With Imaginary Interfaces we re-enable spatial interaction on screenless devices. Users point and draw in the empty space in front of them or on the palm of their hands. While they cannot see the results of their interaction, they do obtain some visual feedback by watching their hands move. Our user studies show that Imaginary Interfaces allow users to create simple drawings, to annotate with them and to operate interfaces, as long as their layout mimics a physical device they have used before. We demonstrate how this allows an imaginary interface to serve as a shortcut for a physical device and we believe that ultimately Imaginary Interfaces will lead to the development of standalone ultra-mobile devices.","[1]	Apple. iPhone VoiceOver http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision.html \ [2]	Gustafson, S., Baudisch, P., Gutwin, C.,and Irani, P.

This can be achieved through finger-worn sensors that track their movements. I am particular interested in finger gestures that are feasible while grasping devices. Executing gestures on a steering wheel while driving, such as those seen in Fig. 1, are just some examples of interactions, which would not require any device-release. The resulting question is: To what extent can users interact with grasped objects through tiny microgestures that are performed while grasping? This extended abstract shows the progress of my research and presents the design of a study that is in preparation. Around this study design I formulated research questions. My approach aims to apply motor and mental models for designing interactions and interfaces regarding human motor abilities, interaction favors, and the mental model of themselves within their environment.","1.

In sharp contrast to collections of physical possessions in the home, in the digital realm there are few possessions that are considered special. As a result, digital possessions are infrequently used, e.g. for reminiscing or storytelling. By studying cherished physical and digital possessions and designing novel products or systems, this PhD explores how digital media can become more cherished. More specifically, newly created designs will aim to integrate physical and digital realms and encourage novel creation or augmentation of digital media, here called digital craft, as a promising means to increase attachment to digital possessions.","[1]	Bell, G., and Gemmell, J.

ARGs also represent a new genre of transmedia practice where players collaboratively hunt for clues, make sense of disparate information, and solve puzzles to advance an ever-evolving storyline. While players participate in an ARG using everyday communications tools, such as phones and web sites, the interaction design challenges are not an ""everyday"" process. Designers must create and connect story bits across multiple media (video, audio, text) and multiple platforms (phones, computers, physical spaces). Further, they must engage and connect with players of varying skill levels. Few studies have explored the design process of education-based ARGs, or their relationship to participatory design. This research systematically investigates the design and play of ARGs as participatory design spaces and vehicles for scaffolding information literacy practices. ","1. Bonsignore, E. (2011).

Rooted in the Minimalist Learning Theory and theories in problem-solving and creativity, the Idea Garden aims to facilitate end-user programmers to generate and work with their own ideas. Expected benefits of this work include both a theory-based understanding of barriers and the Idea Garden approach itself, which is intended to be generalizable across different end-user programming environments.","[1]	Cao, J., Riche, Y., Wiedenbeck, S., Burnett, M., Grigoreanu, G., End-user mashup programming: through the design lens, In Proc.

To achieve effective and efficient teaching, teachers use nonverbal behaviors to communicate the focus of their attention and highlight important concepts. With the advance of technology, embodied agents (i.e., robots) keep showing promises of supporting human activities. The goal of my dissertation is to design effective nonverbal behaviors, with a concentration on gaze, hand gestures, and head movements, for embodied agents as teachers or learning partners to support people in learning. To this end, my research focuses on understanding how and what nonverbal behaviors contribute to effective learning, implementing behavioral patterns from this understanding on embodied agents, and evaluating the effectiveness of the embodied agents in various educational contexts.","1.
