The games and entertainment community has been growing continuously in the past three years. During CHI 2012 a two days workshop on Games User Research was held, and the growing number of game-oriented submissions show the importance of the field. In 2013 the successful Student Games Competition is continued and we plan for engaging game content during CHI 2013. The games and entertainment community is the only community that got the agreement of the Conference Management Committee of SIGCHI to extend the existence beyond the initial three years. The Games and Entertainment Community is thus extended for the years 2014 and following. It is of immense importance for the community to have a possibility to discuss new perspectives for the Games and Entertainment Community in a SIG.","games","","Oct  5 04:39"

This has led to a lack of awareness about what research is currently being carried out, and misunderstandings about how different fields can contribute to the design of usable and secure systems.  By drawing interested members of the CHI community from design, user experience, engineering, and HCI Security, this SIG will take the first steps towards creating a research agenda for interactive secure system design.  In the SIG, we will summarise recent initatives to develop a research programme in interactive secure system design, network members of the CHI community with an interest in this research area, and initiate a roadmap towards addressing identified research challenges and building an interactive secure system design community.

However visions related to the progress of technology are not new. Creative and insightful visionaries from Denis Diderot to Vannerar Bush have been postulating visions of possible futures or technology for centuries. Some idealised views end up discredited with advances in knowledge, while others now appear remarkably prescient. The question is, do visions and the process of creating them have a place in CHI, or are they simply flights of fancy? \  \ This SIG meeting provides a forum for visionaries; researchers and practitioners looking to consider the place and importance of visions within CHI. Can visions, the process of visioning and forming new visions help us refine, advance or develop new research or forms of interaction. And if visions are important to us, then are they part of the regular academic process? If so, should CHI provide venues for publishing new visions?","","","Oct  5 16:41"

Mechanical controls and electrical systems are transformed to the digital realm. It is common that drivers operate a vehicle and, at the same time, interact with a variety of devices and applications. Texting while driving, looking up an address for the navigation system, and taking a phone call are just some common examples that add value for the driver, but also increase the risk of driving. Novel interaction technologies create many opportunities for designing useful and attractive in-car user interfaces. With technologies that assist the user in driving, such as assistive cruise control and lane keeping, the user interface is essential to the way people perceive the driving experience. New means for user interface development and interaction design are required as many other conditions have an influence on the design space for automotive user interfaces. In comparison to other domains, a trial and error approach while the product is already in the market is not acceptable as the cost of failure may be fatal. User interface design in the automotive domain is relevant across many areas ranging from primary driving control, to assisted functions, to navigation, information services, entertainment and games and the communication with the environment and other cars.","design, engineering, user experience, games","","Oct  5 15:16"

As an extreme, some startups have even been founded with a focus purely on designing and developing for mobile platforms. So why have we not seen this same proliferation and mobile focus in the enterprise application space? In this SIG, we plan to discuss and debate some of the reasons for this lagging on the enterprise side.
