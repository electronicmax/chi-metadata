"sr102","","Anti-Bump: A Bump/Pothole Monitoring and  Broadcasting system for Driver Awareness","Mohamed","Fekry","m.ramadan@fcih.net","no","incomplete","Mohamed Fekry","Mohamed","Fekry","m.ramadan@fcih.net","Computer Science","Helwan","Cairo","Cairo","Egypt","","","","","","","This paper presents a system for bump detection and alarming system for drivers.  We have presented an architecture that adopts context awareness and Bump location broadcasting to detect and save bumps locations. \   \ This system uses motion sensor to get the readings of the bump then we classify it using Hidden Markov Model and  Neural  Network. We keep records for the bump  location through tracking it geographic position. We developed a system that alarms the driver within appropriate profiled distance for bump occurrence. \  \ We conducted two experiments for testing the system in a street modeled architect with different kinds of bumps and potholes. The other experiment was on real street bumps. The results show that the system can detect bumps and potholes with high accuracy.","","","Nov 19 23:50"

Most of the people living in rural areas of India donâ€™t have java enabled cell phones and the Internet facility through which WAP/GPRS based applications work, is also very limited. Nowadays SMS is very popular and frequently used worldwide including India. So, SMS based m-banking can be extended as a secure channel for users by enhancing the security of SMS. This concept of providing a secure channel can be implemented on a separate SIM. In this approach, first a mutual authentication will take place followed by a secure transmission of SMS to a banking server. SMS can be encrypted using symmetric cryptographic algorithm (like DES, Triple DES, ASE, Blowfish, Twofish, CAST6, RC2 and RC6). To maintain the integrity of SMS, an authentication function (like MD5, SHA1, SHA2, HMAC etc) must be implemented which will prevent from SMS tampering and message disclosure. Prevention from repudiation attack needs to implement digital signature (like RSA, DSA, ECDSA etc.). As per the result observations AES takes minimum time for ciphering. AES-256 is been preferred over AES-128 due to its strong cryptanalysis. Apart from this, ECDSA is better for signature generation and verification. It takes less time and has strong structure that also reduces key size as compared to DSA. SHA-1 is used as message digest to maintain the integrity of message content.","","consider_wip","Dec  1 07:27"
