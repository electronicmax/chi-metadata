By using iterative development with usability testing (with diverse users), we were able to achieve faster results toward the overall usability of the information architecture. We also learned that working with a third-party developer can significantly slow the process of achieving full accessibility.  \  \ Often the user testing immediately impacted the site through a series of changes. As the user testing improved the site, the time performance for the usability testing tasks improved.

Paratroopers, in particular, must be able to parachute into a battlefield and locate and assemble their equipment as quickly and quietly as possible. Current assembly methods rely on bulky and antiquated equipment that inhibit the speed and effectiveness of such operations. To address this we have created a multi-modal mobile navigation system that uses ruggedized to mark assembly points and smartphones to assist in navigating to these points while minimizing cognitive load and maximizing situational awareness. To achieve this task, we implemented a novel beacon receiver protocol that allows an infinite number of receivers to listen to the encrypted beaconing message using only ad-hoc Wi-Fi technologies.  The system was evaluated by U.S. Army Paratroopers and proved quick to learn and efficient at moving Soldiers to navigation waypoints. Beyond military operations, this system could be applied to any task that requires the assembly and coordination of many individuals or teams, such as emergency evacuations, fighting wildfires or locating airdropped humanitarian aid.

The main contribution of this user study and subsequent deployment conducted in the DDPBD (Lodz, Poland) is (a) identifying key differences between post-communist healthcare practice and Western environments in terms of technology and (b) determining the unexpected issues that appear when involving eastern-european physicians in a participatory design process. \  \ We have managed to identify the key obstacles on the road to seamless medical data sharing infrastructure. These include the physical separation of the institutions and separated governance of the hospitals as well as several human-related reasons. We have determined that habits contrary to good IT practice are in place and that medical personnel is willing to improve provided their basic IT needs are fulfilled in a manner they imagine. \ We believe that the human factor was more difficult to overcome than the infrastructural difficulties. The system presented here illustrates that performance and efficiency can be improved in some cases without redesigning the entire infrastructure. We notice that the design process must consider social relationships in doctor teams and the hierarchical structure of the institution. Furthermore, we indicate the often conflicting intereststhat are common in eastern-european medical practice and severly impact developing interactive systems for physicians. \  \ Most importantly, we have noticed that the way the DDPBD operates is highly different from Western hospitals and the acceptance of technology is highly determined by the attitude of the division heads and relationships between department members. The physicians have been involved in the design process as much as their limited time allowed for. Not only the organisation of the ward, but also the habits and preconceptions of the physicians are different and must be accommodated in different ways. In order to achieve full success and enable building more complex computational systems for this specific hospital environment even more studies of the doctors' attitudes toward technologies must be conducted.","health","","http://prezi.com/tty9qmx4flpz/unexpected-images-from-the-inside-notes-from-an-eastern-european-medical-workspace/?auth_key=7e43a6dccf6ffc1859701c58b13334fdb652c988","","Oct  4 10:56"

Their adventure will prove successful if they are able to execute on serving than unmet need or solution that is better than what is available on the market. As the company matures, the key to growth slowly shifts away from proving their hunch, to efficient execution in order to serve the lines of customers. \  \ This focus on efficiency leads companies to hire the best talent and provide them a workspace that minimizes latency between similarly skilled team members.  However, this environment is not ideally suited for what drives innovation in user centered design, cross pollination of ideas and experiences. \  \ Qualcomm, which employs more than 23,000 employees worldwide, wanted to see if it could have the best of both worlds:  an efficient organizational structure tuned for optimal execution, combined with a more organically created second layer, where network connections are made to foster ideation and discovery of the next-next thing across all teams. \  \ Babak Forutanpour, head of Qualcomm’s Forward Looking User Experience (FLUX) program, will share his experiences and key lessons learned in building an organic, cross-discipline engine of innovation. The program is completely run by volunteer employees who have organized and capture over 45 patents-pending, and numerous prototypes.

However, as one of the causes of increasing population with chronic diseases, low adherence has become a major healthcare issue globally. Often, due to deferred benefits of treatment or lifestyle recommendations, many fail to adhere to their treatment regimen or health plans given by care providers until their conditions deteriorate. As poor adherence remains a significant yet inadequately addressed problem of severe health issues, it is critical to create effective interventions as part of the solutions. Previous studies have suggested that peer supports be effective to improve adherence, and social cognitive theories have indicated that personal realization and confidence enhanced through entertaining gaming elements could encourage behavior change. To understand how different motivation factors affect user experience through social networking, a healthcare adherence website with built-in behavior analyses was constructed to conduct experiments. Users' health adherence levels can be reported to the website and shared among consenting social members for discussion or competition. Key design and development components are illustrated through the case study, including a social gaming and learning portal, an engineering approach to supporting different application scenarios, and information interventions based on predefined rules to achieve effective adherence. The preliminary analysis showed that people using social media for healthcare adherence may be motivated differently and act strategically during their social interactions. \ ","health","","","","Oct  3 16:34"

The quality of these interfaces in terms of usability and user experience is critical since  distraction and other negative causes of the system usage can have fatal effects. But even the best designed system causes distraction and has improvement potential. Therefore it is necessary to inform drivers of the risk that is involved in the usage of automotive HMIs. This case study therefore shows how we addressed this issue by evaluating these interfaces to inform a range of stakeholders about their qualities. These stakeholders include the automotive companies themselves, as well as journalists and motor clubs, that transport the message to the end users and politicians.  \  \ This case study describes the development of a method package for holistically evaluating in-car HMIs. The goal is to provide a toolbox that is easy to replicate and allows evaluators to identify the effects of the system usage on the driver as well as interface flaws that cause them.

While energy efficiency is a topic of high societal relevance and large investments, HCI research and development projects so far mostly been focused on private homes, but rarely on potentially more promising large building contexts. If viable solutions could be found in case studies, larger roll-outs could be expected to have significant impact both on energy awareness promoted by pupils, as well as on actual energy consumptions  \  \ In order to evaluate the requirements and necessary implementations for energy saving, the project set up a trial testbed at a secondary school in Kirchdorf, Austria. Our initial requirements research was based on workshops with project classes, contextual interviews with janitors, as well as with teachers. We found that energy saving technology in schools must especially include the consideration of organizational and social aspects, and that responsibility of stakeholders for system operation need to be clearly defined beforehand. We also gained evidence together with the pupils that power management would be most efficient when enabling people to remotely switch off computers that are not in use.  \  \ Based on a broad online questionnaire study at the school with 390 respondents, we found that pupils could be strong contributors to consumption reduction, if they were provided with the necessary empowerment. This motivated us to move on with first designs of a power management system, which we evaluated by comparing various forms of information density in three different school contexts (lecture, discussion, break). Based on the gathered learnings, we decided to discard low-density / low-interactivity displays for the final service prototype.  \  \ We finally ran a 17-week long field trial, in which we first measured energy consumption under standard conditions and then with the operation of our functional power management service. One class was provided with a tablet hanging at a central place in the classroom and to another class we provided six smartphones that could be used by individual pupils. We found that the power management service indeed had a significant energy reduction effect, but there was no significant difference in the energy savings with regard to whether a tablet or smartphones were used. We can therefore recommend the integration of power management systems within a larger number of schools, but only if they are thoroughly tested.   \  \ We think that applying a large variety of user research methods is crucial in order to enable generalizable design guidance in the special setting of a school. Particularly the enrichment of broad questionnaire studies with focused workshops and contextual interviews provided a good decision basis for our and hopefully also future projects. We learned within our user requirements that pupils need to be guided very thoroughly through empirical investigations, both as supporters and respondents. Furthermore, especially in a functional trial with a pre-mature prototype, high communication efforts must be planned into the project, in order to keep teachers and the school management informed about potential risks within the IT system operation.

Media companies are faced with actual changes triggered by technological progress. The market pressure to work more effective, efficient and to improve the quality forces media companies to re-design their processes and take a convergent value-added process chain into account. Therefore our stakeholders came up with the idea to develop an investigation/monitoring tool to support their staff in their daily work. \  \ Concerning the processes and management of media data the basic goals were established based on the current state of research and the daily practice of our partners:  \ * Make investigation more efficient and effective \ * Optimize workflows in daily work \ * Use potentials of ongoing technologies due to market pressure and innovation \ * Monitoring of data channels and (prod)users \ * Collecting data and calculate topic relevances \  \ A new project was started to find possible improvements based on the daily user tasks of editors and writers working in the media company. At first we analyzed and documented the requirements in workshops with different stakeholders, especially the end users. Then it turned out that there are some special requirements concerning processes, search, visualization and relevance calculation for media articles which have to be revealed with domain experts.  \  \ In an iterative conception and design phase we developed ideas with creative techniques, paper prototyping and interactive prototyping. In cooperation with stakeholders we chose one of the ideas for refinement and development. In some meetings which were conducted as focus groups we even revealed further requirements. \  \ In the subsequent development phase we followed an agile approach and integrated important stakeholders in the development process. Frequent reviews led us to the actual working system called MMVisT. At the current state of the project we got more funds to further develop MMVisT and improve design, number of data sources, relevance calculation and search techniques. \  \ Help editors and writers in media companies to overview, find and select relevant information for new topics and thus simplify the creation of new articles. React on the participation of (prod)users in convergent workflows. \  \ With our holistic usability engineering approach we came to some interesting findings and best practices we learned: \ * a combination of methods and an iterative holistic approach helped us to analyze the requirements \ * by integrating the stakeholders into the development process we could make important decisions concerning technology, concepts, processes, search, visualization, interaction and design  \ * search and visualization techniques are needed to manage the large amount of data \ * processes in media companies have to be adapted based on (prod)users and media convergence \ * relevance for articles and topics can calculated based on many different (web) data sources \ * it is still to prove if effectiveness, efficiency and quality can be improved by our tool","engineering, management","","http://prezi.com/2e8abkp3bjdi/multimedia-data-management-with-monitoring-and-visualization/","There are included pictures and a video about the MMVisT Case Study reflecting some of the used usability engineering methods and the working MMVisT investigation/monitoring system: \ - digitalized images of first paper prototypes \ - screenshots of first interactive prototypes and technical feasibility studies \ - screenshots of the final MMVisT working system \ - a screen captured video of the working system with a walkthrough of one search use case and the different visualizations (remark: no audio provided, the video format is mp4 so please be sure to have the correct player and codec - I will try to include the screen video with audio in the PREZI file) \  \ Questions or additional information can be requested by email: \ fredrik.gundelsweiler@gmail.com ","Oct  5 10:01"

However, several critical features, including support for low resourced languages and nonstandard writing systems, must be in place before linguists will be able to take full advantage of these sorts of translation tools. Policy constraints also factored into the final recommendations.  \  \ Best Practices Learned: Multiple methods of assessing user preferences and workflow led to more refined recommendations for the adoption of software. Policy considerations were critical in assessing the feasibility of some of software solutions, the contextual inquiry revealed which features were required, a usability assessment of existing software confirmed the findings and identified further issues to consider, and a systematic heuristic evaluation helped us to clarify the recommendations.   \ ","user experience","","","PDF File containing Study Descriptions, Appendices, and References","Oct  5 12:45"

Instead of looking for material caches, players of RealityCaching (users with a mobile phone equipped with GPS and camera) can find and share with friends virtual caches with several multimedia contents (e.g. photos, videos, songs, messages) and gain points thanks to these activities. They can access these “gifts” by reaching the geographic location of the cache and positioning their phone according to the spatial coordinates of the object (for example, the cache could be placed on the top of a tree, so the user has to move the phone to capture the cache). The main contributes given by the AR on a basic geo-caching application are the impossibility to take away the cache from its place (voluntary or not) and the opportunity to dedicate a cache to a specific friend or group, while the incentive to go outdoors remains the same as the original game model. \  \ The goal of this case study is to collect data of human mobility and habits by using the Game With a Purpose (GWAP) paradigm, implemented on the RealityCaching mobile app. For example, we plan to discover the patterns of different routes chosen to reach a specific location by different users, their favorite spots to place caches according to the content of the caches, etc. Starting from these results, we will improve our RealityCaching app (e.g. with new features or interaction improvements) and also create new apps and services useful for the player (e.g. services based on users’ needs brought out by the use of the game).  \ ","games","","","Demo of the prototype of the RealityCaching iOS app. \ The used format is an interactive PowerPoint presentation that must be played in Slide Show mode.","Oct  5 17:16"

We did this in real ICTD research projects, in-situ, with real people, in a real business: 5 years, 5 pilot scenarios, 3 projects, 3 West African countries. \  \ Findings: \  \ Using action research and user centered design in ICTD software development ensures a tight end user interaction, minimizes the risk of failure, and creates reusable, scalable, and sustainable solutions. \  \ Extensive field studies up front resulting in personas and scenarios, establishment of local contacts, and the role of a change manager avoid design vs reality gaps. \  \ Rapid prototyping and end user workshops with early paper prototypes and later functional prototypes ensure the tight integration of end users in the entire design and avoids inappropriate developments. \  \ The structured process of three subsequent cyclic phases of the methodology supports the phases of development, transition, and productive use.

We developed a hybrid game using both table-top as well as SMS interactions to engage families in discussions about health. Our research investigates the following; (1) how games can influence an individuals understanding of their health and lifestyle behaviors, (2) how individuals share knowledge through the hybridization of services, table-top and SMS games, and health messaging, (3) how structural, environmental and social factors within restaurant settings enable individuals to start conversations and share ideas about healthy eating. \  \ In August 2011, the Fitwits program (www.fitwits.org) was approached by Eat’n Park, a regional restaurant chain to create a five-week promotional game to help families start conversations about nutrition and correct portion sizes while enjoying their meal. The partnership provided an opportunity for cross-sector collaboration, implementing Fitwits into 73 Eat’n Park Restaurants across Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, with the potential to reach 85,000 families during the promotional period. To accomplish this, we needed to work with academic, nonprofit and private companies in addition to the IRB review board to develop this program implemented in a public restaurant chain. \  \ During the Fitwits promotion there was a 5.8% year-over-year increase in sales of healthy meal options sold off the kids menu. A high number of collector cards and games were requested by families which is an indication that interest and engagement in the game was high. Families that played the integrated SMS game showed very good engagement in the game, with 74% rate of completing the game for those that started to play. In addition, many families went on to explore other aspects of the SMS interaction including checking recipes and providing feedback about their experience. The engagement of the family in discussion about health was reflected in both user feedback as well as reports by restaurant staff.  \  \ The results collected from the SMS game illustrate that table-top games in combination with the SMS messaging system was impactful helped facilitate conversations about health. As indicated on the post-survey from the Eat’n Park employees, much work is needed to better train staff on dissemination procedures if the promotion is implemented again. It was also clear from staff feedback that better marketing and more complete integration into the restaurant experience would improve recognition of the game and engagement. \  \ In summary, one of our main goals was to maximize the educational potential of an idle moment in the customers' restaurant experience–waiting for their meals, affording a method of engagement that was both fun and accessible. In this context, desirable behavior change includes: (a) increasing the ability for people to learn new skills that will help them identify and change bad habits, (b) using the dinner table as a proactive space where participants openly engage and communicate about their own families’ health. We feel we have made a first step into a very exciting area of research and look forward to using the information from our case study to create a more formalized study.","health, games","","","One PDF with the following: \  \ - Feedback collected from SMS messages \ - Wireframe of SMS game \ - Copies of two published articles: \  \ MCGAFFEY A, ABATEMARCO DJ, JEWELL IK, FIDLER SK, HUGHES K.

Text input is often ambiguous and requires repeated refinement before users receive their desired results. While this repetitive cycle can be frustrating for English-speaking users, for Asian language searchers the cycle is but one step in a more arduous journey to search success. They may be initially confronted by a keyboard that has no native language characters, may be required to enter characters in their native language using an Input Method Editor (IME), and may be able to enter their query in multiple character sets (e.g., for Japanese speakers, Romaji, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji). This paper presents one program of research investigating these and similar issues in Japan. Given the multiple links in the chain from input to intent, we investigated the issues using multiple methods (task analysis, logs analysis, usability study, live testing) and produced recommendations across multiple domains (search suggestion, related search, spelling correction) as well. We believe that fellow researchers and international users alike will benefit from learning about our methods and our substantive findings.","user experience","","","","Oct  5 17:01"

In order to ease the risk of these systems being compromised, we pursued three related research themes. First, we developed an expert systems engine that tracks users’ system inputs and delivers accurate mitigation notifications. Second, we designed a user interface that allows easy navigation of selections and easily affords inputs required by the expert systems via notifications. Third, we explored the importance of gaining users’ trust in the expert system notifications by automatically generating explanations for content recommendations. In usability testing, our interface was quickly adopted; users demanded to have it integrated within the organization immediately. Further, our approach of combining multiple push notifications and guidance questions—resulting from various machine learning methods—has produced real-time mitigation recommendations. \   \ Author Keywords \ Information systems; law enforcement; boundary regulations; design; rapid prototyping; immersive research; concept validation; machine learning \  \ Synopsis of Best Practices Learned \ There is no substitute for validating your concept in real, real-life situations.

When developing expert systems, in which the knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) is embedded, the knowledge transfer bottleneck between SMEs and system development team should be avoided. \ To discover the bottleneck, the stakeholders should clearly recognize the difference among 1) perceiving the knowledge; 2) executing the knowledge; and 3) describing the knowledge.  \  \ Given the fact that learning from explicit description (e.g., document) does not guarantee the full knowledge transfer of SMEs, our best practice demonstrated how to perceive SME’s knowledge by observing SMEs’ action. By utilizing SMEs’ activity simulation with think aloud protocol, we discovered 17 criteria to be added to existing expert system, in which only 7 criteria were implemented. By tracing back the development process and collaboration logistics of the target system, we also found that the involvement of SMEs were limited and passive during the development process because the way that the SMEs contributed to the development was determined by the decision maker of the development team.  \  \ Note that such a limited collaboration lacks the acquisition of SMEs' knowledge in action, we highly recommend the system development team to visit SMEs’ work sites to observe SMEs’ specific decision making process in action that may not be discovered by the development team otherwise. \ ","design","","","","Oct  5 19:51"

This process also brought in cross divisional alignment and skills from UX design, research, development, product management, brand, and more.

One of these is the integration of both deductive and inductive pattern development techniques require rigorous user experience research methodologies, which we outline in our presentation. Also, the importance of iterative pattern development based on actual user feedback is vital to establishing credibility within the organization. This must be paired with internal feedback and content reviews to combat a ""made here"" mentality to gain political integrity. Lastly, the integration in this guideline development process with marketing and product management to establish target markets and user goals. \  \ Autodesk accomplished this moving from six or more internal libraries and guideline sets to a single curated, growing system in 6 months.

This immersion exercise allowed non-UX professionals to feel firsthand the delight and pain of our users when using our products. It strengthened the bond between product-focused Googlers and 'their' users and called attention to issues that needed immediate attention. \  \ Our goals in describing this project are twofold. First, we want draw attention to the fact that user research typically is a process embedded in an organization where success is not just determined by classic scientific benchmarks (validity, reliability, or - possibly - citation count), but predominantly by the improvements made to products. We can think of it as real-world impact factors. Methodological publications in HCI, as well as the education of practitioners, in our view gloss over this need (Granka, Larvie, Riegelsberger EPIC 2008).  \  \ Second, we believe that user researchers in other product development organizations can learn from our successes and failures with Project Pokerface. We hope they will be able to further evolve and adapt this method to affect positive change in their organizations.  \  \ We are aware that the success of such approaches strongly depends on the organizational culture. The way in which priorities are set, how tasks are managed, how incentives are given to engineers and product managers will influence not only the success of such an endeavor, but also its feasibility within an organization. Google, with its culture of engineering autonomy, 20% time, and consensus-driven decision-making is probably a unique environment, yet it also showcases some of work methods that other organizations are aiming for.","management, user experience","","https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vm2i8oB2hXYH216EBpybWhFoefqmlA6MEyqxYUjssLg/edit","","Oct  5 18:57"

When it comes to usability testing, not all the available methods which work well with adults are equally applicable with child participants. In our study, we investigated two methods, Peer Tutoring which was developed for children, and Active Intervention which originates from the more traditional Think- Aloud methodology with adults. Our goal was to find out which of the two methods does elicit more comments by 8-10 years old boys when using a web application. The results showed that Peer Tutoring did elicit the greatest number of comments. At the same time the number of prompts provided by the test moderator was tendentially lower than during Active Intervention. According to previous research we classified the comments provided by the children in three categories: in action, planning, and perception and cognition comments. This brought to light that more action and tendentially planning comments were provided during Peer Tutoring than during Active Intervention. The number of perception and cognition comments did not differ between the two methods. \  \ Best practices learned: \ - Peer Tutoring enabled us to provide a rather natural test situation to the children, and at the same time learn more about our product thus about how children perceive it. \  \ - Based on these results we concluded that Peer Tutoring can help to elicit more self-motivated responses. \  \ - We observed the same result tendencies and advantages in several Peer Tutoring studies with young children of both genders. \  \ - The study design, i.e. the methods used, are well replicable for other practitioners. \ ","user experience, cci","","","1) The first .pdf file (1_PeerTutoring-Paper_CHI2013.pdf) is our paper which the Keynote presentation is actually based on.

In fact, the digital product industry confronts this alarming paradox: More and more UX teams claim to follow user-centered processes, yet most digital products are mediocre or even substandard. And things won’t get easier. As interactions progress from clicks to taps and other gestures, traditional UCD processes will face even greater challenges. In our experience, one reason for poor design execution is that there is a separation between the design and development of the presentation layer. UX teams need to own more than just design. We need to own front-end development. In fact, we argue that front-end development has always been more strongly aligned with design than with development.

This case study focuses on the design and development of the platform and operation control system. Reliability prevails on usability during the development process but delivered ground segment applications suffer from usability issues and operators are providing negative feedback (in the last five years, there has even been one case of a xM€ ground segment application being design, built and delivered but never used). \  \ The presented case study exposes how a UCD approach has been successfully integrated to the existing CNES development process. The TORTUGA (Task, Operations, Reliability and Training for Users of Ground Applications) project has been set up to experiment a new development approach for ground segment applications. The team gathered engineers and researchers from CNES (ground segment products department, missions and operations department), as well as engineers and researchers from IRIT lab (Interactive Critical Systems team). The project first focused on a particular satellite mission in order to precisely observe and analyze operators’ activities and the tools they were using. The main steps of the project were then to integrate UCD techniques, such as task analysis, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping, to the existing development process. Low-fidelity prototyping and high-fidelity prototyping phases are the core of our best practice solution. They are iterative and supported by modeling and development software tools which have been designed for this purpose. This best practice solution has been validated on a ground segment application of another mission. Head of ground segment products department agreed on the benefits of UCD and its capability to ensure usability. Since then, the proposed solution has been integrated in the new ground segment products development process imposed by CNES to its software suppliers. \ ","design, engineering, management","","","","Oct  8 06:34"
