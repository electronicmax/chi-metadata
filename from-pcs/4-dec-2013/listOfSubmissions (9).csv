We believe that it is the right time to ‘really’ talk about user experience and its theoretical roots and relationship with practice. Although user experience is overused as a buzzword, it defines a main step change in the evolvement of the HCI field and deserves a proper (theoretical) attention. Within this panel we follow up on discussions on the theoretical foundations and the value of theory for HCI and UX research from over the last years. In particular we want to go a step further and strengthen the interdisciplinary dialogue on the relationship between theory and practice when talking about user experience. We invited HCI and non-HCI panelists to join a fruitful dialogue talking about the different perspectives on user experience, theoretical roots, and relevance of theory for practice and vice versa. Two moderators will ensure that the audience gets their beliefs and thoughts across to the panelists as well.","Marianna Obrist (moderator) \ Peter C Wright (moderator) \ Kari Kuutti (panelist) \ Yvonne Rogers (panelist) \ Kristian Höök (panelist) \ Christian Fuchs (panelist) \ Jean Louis Frechin (panelist)","Oct 18 13:24"

This may be due to a widespread perception that perfect domain-independent speech recognition is an unattainable goal.  Progress is continuously being made in the engineering and science of speech and natural language processing, however, and there is also recent research that suggests that many applications of speech require far less than 100% accuracy to be useful in many contexts. Engaging the CHI community now is timely – many recent commercial applications, especially in the mobile space, are already tapping the increased interest in and need for natural user interfaces (NUIs) by enabling speech interaction in their products. As such, the goal of this panel is to bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to discuss the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions based on spoken language, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech processing in order to gain widespread acceptance of speech and natural language interaction.","Cosmin Munteanu - moderator \ Matt Jones - panelist \ Steve Whittaker - panelist \ Sharon Oviatt - panelist \ Stephen Brewster - panelist \ Nitendra Rajput - panelist \ Gerald Penn - contributing author not participating \ Amit Nanavati - contributing author not participating","Oct  5 18:27"

Activism traditionally takes a wide range of forms from writing letters to newspapers or politicians, political campaigning, economic activism such as boycotts or preferentially patronizing businesses, rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, and hunger strikes. Technology plays an increasingly tantamount role in enabling activist agendas, supporting activist activities and self-organization, bringing people together on causes they support and giving them the tools and platforms in pursuing activist goals. CHI has seen an influx of work on activist agendas – within communities such as HCI for Peace, HCI4All, Social Sustainability, Bottom of the Pyramid related bodies of work, post-colonial CHI, and many more. What is CHI’s role in supporting or enabling activist causes, if any?

Worldwide there is a gender gap in technology with only a small part of all computer science related positions being held by women. Given the impact and potential ramifications of technology on our society, it is imperative that both male and female perspectives are included in shaping our modern day technologies. Among different initiatives to encourage women to join STEM fields, the “Women’s Perspective in HCI Initiative”, started at CHI2011, focuses on women in the specific STEM field of HCI. This panel focuses on the representation of women perspectives in technologies we design, analyze, and use. There are many barriers when it comes to getting women perspectives into system designs such as the small amount of HCI gender research currently in the literature, analysis of gender-agnostic software tools which fit female problem-solving approaches, and looking at the representation of the feminists perspective in our current discourse. This panel will address these barriers and the diversity chasm with respect to the tools and technologies we experience. ","Susan M. Dray - Panelist \ Andrea Peer - Moderator \ Anke M.
