Being empathetic implies that the computer is able to recognize user’s affective states and understand the implication of those states. Automatic detection of affective states requires the computer: to sense information; to process and understand information integrating several sources that could range from brain-waves signals and biofeedback readings, passing from gestures recognition, to posture and pressure sensing; and to apply algorithms and data processing tools to understand user’s affective states.  \  \ Through this course, attendees will:  \  \ a) Learn about sensing approaches used to detect affective states: brain-computer interfaces, face-based emotion recognition systems, eye-tracking system, and physiological sensors –including skin conductivity, posture, and pressure sensors—.  \  \ b) Understand the pros and cons of the diverse sensing approaches used to detect affective states.  \  \ c) Learn about the data that is gathered from each device and understand its characteristics.  \  \ d) Learn about approaches and tools to pre-process, synchronize, and analyze data.  \  \ This course is open to researchers, practitioners, and educators interested in incorporating affective computing as part of their adaptive and personalized technology toolbox.  \  \ The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction with demonstrations and exercises, all aimed to help making the topic concrete, memorable, and actionable.","engineering, user experience","","This is the handout (PDF file) for the CHI 2012 version of this course.","2","","Sep 26 06:32"

Improving UX during product development and research requires evaluation, but traditional usability testing methods are not adequate for evaluating UX. The evaluation methods for investigating how users feel about the tested system are still less known in the HCI community.  \  \ Since 2008, the instructors have been collecting a comprehensive set of 80 UX evaluation methods both from academia and industry, which is now available at www.allaboutux.org/all-methods. During this course, we will present an overview of the set of methods and present some methods in more detail. \  \ By the end of this course, you will be able to choose suitable methods for your specific user experience evaluation case. You will understand the difference between UX evaluation and traditional usability evaluation methods, as well as the variety of UX evaluation methods available. \  \ This course will cover the following topics: \ -	the general targets of UX evaluation \ -	the various kinds of UX evaluation methods available for different purposes (an overview) \ -	how to choose the right method for the purpose \ -	the basics of a sample of UX methods of different types \ -	guidance on where to find more information on those methods \  \ Our target audience consists of researchers and practitioners who want to get acquainted with user experience evaluation methods.

By understanding the psychology underlying design guidelines, designers and evaluators can better interpret and apply guidelines.  This course explains that psychology.  Part1 covers perception; Part 2 covers cognition. \  \ Origins: Presented at CHI 2008, 2009, and 2012.  Revised based on forthcoming 2nd edition of book. \  \ Features:  Describes and demonstrates human perception and cognition: \  \ Part 1: Perception \ • Introduction: UI design rules are based on how people perceive, learn, think, and act \ • Factors that bias perception \ • Vision is optimized to perceive structure (Gestalt principles) \ • We seek and use structure \ • Color vision is limited \ • Peripheral vision is poor \  \ Part II: Cognition \ • Our attention is limited; our memory is imperfect \ • Limits on attention shape our thought and action \ • Recognition is easier than recall \ • Learning from experience and executing learned actions are easy; novel actions, problem-solving, and calculation are hard \ • Our thought and decision-making are (mostly) not rational \ • Real-time characteristics of perception and thought \  \ Audience:  Software designers and developers, Q/A engineers, usability testers, and managers. \  \ Presentation:  Lecture, demonstrations with audience participation, Q&A. \  \ Instructor:  Jeff Johnson is Principal Consultant at UI Wizards, a usability consultancy.

This two-part version was presented at CHI 2011 and CHI 2012.  It is based on the presenter’s book, Conceptual Models. \  \ Features: An important early step in designing a user interface for a software application is to design a coherent, task-focused conceptual model. Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software development. Many designers jump right into sketching and prototyping the UI before they understand the application at a conceptual level.  The result is incoherent, overly-complex applications that expose concepts irrelevant to users’ tasks.  The course covers: \  \ • What conceptual models are, and how they can improve UI design, \ • Perils of not designing a conceptual model, \ • Object/actions analysis, \ • An example conceptual model, \ • Outputs of conceptual analysis, \ • A hands-on exercise in performing Object/Actions analysis for an app. \  \ Audience:  Software designers and developers, Q/A engineers, usability testers, and managers. \  \ Presentation: Lecture, Q&A, class small-group exercise. \  \ Instructor:  Jeff Johnson is Principal Consultant at UI Wizards, a usability consultancy.

In ""UI is Communication"", Everett McKay explains how to design intuitive user interfaces by focusing on effective human communication. A user interface is ultimately a conversation between users and technology. Well-designed user interfaces use the language of UI to communicate to users efficiently and naturally.

Home entertainment is therefore transforming from a standalone electrical appliance (the TV set) into an experience shared throughout the environment (the interactive TV). Digital and real are being mixed in complex engaging scenarios for the design of which engineers and architects must work together to deliver new standards of multisensory experiences. In this vision of future home entertainment, remote controls don’t find their place any longer. As such standard input devices can’t handle the ever increasing number of functionalities without ruining and diminishing user experience, new interaction paradigms must be explored. Among these, gestural interfaces represent a potentially viable candidate for which an increased interest has been manifested recently from the TV industry.  \  \ This course explores gestural interfaces for home entertainment scenarios by discussing gesture acquisition and recognition techniques while focusing on designing for the interactive TV. Case studies from research and industry will be discussed and a practical design session reusing the Wii Remote controller for interactive TV scenarios will be included.  \  \ The course addresses researchers and practitioners working in human-computer interaction, user interfaces, and design of home entertainment experiences that plan to include gestures into their designs. A mixture of participants from research and industry will be ideal. No previous knowledge of gesture-based interaction is required. Participants will be gently introduced into today’s widely used gesture acquisition and recognition techniques (with focus on how to select the right technology and recognition algorithm for their projects) accompanied by examples and case studies from the research and industry community of the interactive TV.","games","","This course has been given in an extended form at the European Conference on Interactive TV and Video (EuroITV'12) in Berlin, 2012, as a half-day tutorial with the title: ""Designing Gestural Interfaces for Future Home Entertainment Environments"".

Sketches are lightweight and easy to create, and by varying the fidelity of sketches they can be an integral part during all stages of interaction design. This hands-on course will demonstrate how to integrate sketching into researchers’ and interaction designers’ everyday practice. Participants will learn essential sketching strategies, apply these in practice during various hands-on exercises, and learn the various ways of using sketches as a powerful tool when designing novel interactive systems.  The demonstrated techniques include: \  \ - Sketching vocabulary \ - Quick sketching \ - Best practices \ - Sketch notes \ - 10 plus 10 design funnel \ - Photo tracing \ - Hybrid sketches \ - Storyboards \ - Sketch boards, critique, and sharing \ - Sketching with digital tools \  \ Besides teaching essential sketching strategies, we will also demonstrate how we used sketches for several of our most recent projects of designing novel user experiences with interactive technology. These examples will in particular highlight how to apply the learned sketching techniques during all stages of the design process. We end the tutorial with an overview of additional resources and books about sketching techniques.  \  \ This tutorial does not require any drawing expertise, nor does it emphasize how to draw.

However, overlooking key considerations in questionnaire and survey design can yield skewed or invalid survey results. Fortunately decades of academic research and analysis exist on optimizing the validity and reliability of survey responses, from which this course will draw.  \ By outlining the sources of survey error and considerations for questionnaire design, attendees of this course will gain a practical understanding of high-quality survey research, and the potential negative consequences of lower-quality surveys. The course will focus on common questionnaire biases and pitfalls in the context of the broader survey research life cycle while providing best practices on how to minimize such biases.  \ This course also directly addresses the role of survey research within HCI, examining influential HCI surveys, where survey research can be most valuable for HCI goals, and how surveys can interact with other methods for a more nuanced, valid and actionable view of users via qualitative/quantitative and attitudinal/behavioral data. The course will combine lecture material with interactive breakout exercises that include real world survey examples.

He elaborated that a major issue that confuses and puzzles the human-computer interaction community is the tension between narrow truths proved convincingly by statistically sound experiments, and broad ""truths"", generally applicable, but supported only by possibly unrepresentative observations. That is, results indisputably true but disputably applicable, and results indisputably applicable but perhaps over-generalized. Brooks' question is still relevant.  \ In this tutorial, we will describe the view that the design of complex and novel interactive systems can itself be an area of research, complementing other forms of research, and that it is capable of producing useful and trustworthy results. We call this form of research design-based research, a method of inquiry aimed at exploiting the opportunities that design of complex interactive systems provides to advance our understanding about the problem we are solving, process we are following, and solution we are building. While many designers and researchers already conduct this form of research, and the idea of design-based research is not new , up to date, there have not been many attempts to explicitly define this method. \ The main goal of the tutorial is to give participants better understanding about the scope and limitations of design-based research, and help them to critically review contributions of this kind. In particular, through the tutorials, we will answer the following questions: \  \  * What we learn when we engage in design of interactive systems? \  * What kind of generalizable knowledge we can get from design? \  * What is the relation of design-based research to theoretical and experimental methods? \  * Why design can reveal things that other research methods cannot? \  * What makes design-based research trustworthy? \  * How design activities can be transformed to design-based research? \ ","design","","Course material sample contains a PDF file with course slides.","2","","Oct  5 04:20"

This happens by depicting and transmitting the necessary preconditions und basic methods for intercultural HCI design. Hereby, the tutorial shall show, why cultural aspects play a role in HCI design and why they have to be taken into account and how this is doable for HCI design and within usability engineering. With the help of examples and exercises the aspects will be reflected and intensified. The material begins with a brief history and explanation of need. The main discussion considers the field from three perspectives: what it takes to build usable systems; the psychology of the needed technology; and the computer science of the needed technology. Specific topics include psychologically based data, design methods and tools, user interface media and tools, and introduction to user interface architecture. In each, we will cover research, technology under development, and current application. Sources for follow-on information will be given.  \  \ The following methods will be explicated and exercised more closely. Differences between cultures can be revealed by analyzing critical interaction situations between people (Thomas 1996). Honold 2000 made this method available for cultural differences in HMI. Hereby, critical interaction situations occurring because of problematic user interfaces or the given system functionality are to be analyzed. Furthermore, systems can be looked at as (artificial) agents with an on behaviour, imprinted by the culture of the developer. The internal model of the user for the system is based on the user's culture, his expectations of the features of the system and his interaction experience with the system. Vöhringer-Kuhnt 2002 found out, that e.g. Hofstede's individualism-index is connected with user satisfaction and usability of the product and also has a significant effect on intercultural usability. Röse 2002 suggested the ""method for culture-oriented design"", which integrates the factors of new concepts of culture-oriented HMI design and knowledge of cultural differences into existing concepts of HMI design. Relevant cultural variables for intercultural HMI design must be determined analytically using literature research and requirement studies. Their values represent culture-dependent variations which occur on all levels of HMI-localization (surface, functionality and interaction) (Röse 2002) and can be used for Intercultural User Interface Design (IUID) (Heimgärtner 2007). However, those areas that are the most strongly influenced by culture (like cognitive and ethical aspects) are not directly visible on the surface – only the user behaviour is visible. Hence, especially the analysis of the user behaviour tells us about the cultural imprinting of the user (Röse 2002). One of the most promising methods for gaining cultural differences in HMI is therefore to observe and analyze the user interaction with the system (Heimgärtner 2008). The results in form of cultural variables and their specifications can be used as a base for guidance in intercultural HMI design and for intercultural usability engineering (e.g. cultural interaction indicators, cf. Heimgärtner 2012).  \  \ The tutorial takes 3 hours (i.e. 2 sessions with one break in between). After a general introduction to intercultural HCI design and usability engineering, the methods will be presented in a short lecture in several phases and subsequently trained with the participants with the help of practical examples: \  \ •	Analysis of critical interaction situations (cf. Thomas 1996): Experience and realization of cultural differences – Analysis of the actual condition and the goal condition as well as exchange of experiences – Communication methods, empathy, role reversal, self-perception/outside-image. \  \ •	Method of cultural HCI-Design (MCD, cf. Röse 2002): Identification of cultural differences in HCI design – Knowledge of cultural differences and their effects on HCI design – User-oriented requirement analysis. \  \ •	Analysis of methods in a cultural context (cf. Heimgärtner 2010): Identification of the challenges in the methods of usability engineering in an intercultural context – Knowledge of methodological challenges and their avoidance. \  \ Subsequently, the new knowledge will be discussed, reflected and carried over to the plenum. \  \ Documents for Participants: A handout (containing the presented slides and additional information like exercise sheets, checklists, literature) will be distributed among the participants at the beginning of the tutorial. All presentations and results worked out during the tutorial using blackboard/flip chart and pin board will be electronically documented (by taking pictures) and distributed for the participants of the tutorial via Email. Impersonalized information is also made available on the Website of IUIC (www.iuic.de/tutorials/CHI2013). \  \ ","2","Culture, Intercultural HCI Design, Cultural Differences in HCI \ ","Oct  5 18:32"

User testing, concept validation, focus groups, design walkthroughs, all are expensive in both people’s time and real dollars. \  \ Just as crash dummies in the automotive industry save lives by testing the physical safety of automobiles before they are brought to market, cognitive crash dummies save time, money, and potentially even lives, by allowing designers to automatically test their design ideas before implementing them. Cognitive crash dummies are models of human performance that make quantitative predictions of human behavior on proposed systems without the expense of empirical studies on running prototypes. \  \ When cognitive crash dummies are built into prototyping tools, design ideas can be rapidly expressed and easily evaluated. \ This course reviews the state of the art of predictive modeling and presents a tool that integrates rapid prototyping with modeling. Participants will bring their own laptops and learn to mock-up an interactive system and create a model of skilled performance on that mock-up.

Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas are yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition works, what are its limitations, and how it could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.","","","Course material sample: slides for the previous version of this course, presented at CHI 2012.","2","Automatic Speech Recognition \ Natural Language Processing \ ","Oct  5 17:11"

In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn’t mean it will automatically be accepted in the research community or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies [1] that often kill new ideas [2]—even disruptive innovations [3] that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge—tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs—a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!. Mindjet, HP Consumer Travel, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.","design, management, user experience","","The course material sample represents the version created for an earlier version of this course taught at CHI 2010.

As speech and language-based interaction has significantly increased in recent years (e.g. Apple's Siri, Nuance's Dragon Drive, Google's Voice Search) more experience with relevant design and prototyping methods is required. \ While Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design students are usually introduced to WOZ, only a small proportion of them actually experience it, when compared to exercises based on the use of paper prototypes. Hence, in addition to explaining the concept of language-based WOZ prototyping, a crucial aspect of this course is that attendees will be able to build and dry-run their own WOZ experiments. After a general introduction to WOZ prototyping different types of technology components that are used for building language-based applications are introduced. Then, available WOZ tools are discussed, before finally attendees are engaged into the design and trial of a WOZ experiment. This two-session course is mainly targeted at professionals and students who are new to the field of designing natural language-based user interfaces.  \  \ Instructors: \ Stephan Schlögl and Anne Schneider are final year PhD students at Trinity College Dublin. Stephan's research investigates the challenges and tools for Wizard of Oz prototyping with language technologies, and Anne is pursuing research around the assessment of speech technologies.
