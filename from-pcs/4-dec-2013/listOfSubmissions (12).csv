"to100","","The Impact of Interface Affordances on Human Ideation, Problem Solving and Inferential Reasoning","Sharon","Oviatt","oviatt@incaadesigns.org","no","","Sharon Oviatt, Adrienne Cohen, Andrea Miller, Kumi Hodge, Ariana Mann","Sharon","Oviatt","oviatt@incaadesigns.org","","Incaa Designs","Winslow","Washington","United States","","","","","","Adrienne","Cohen","adrienne.o.cohen@gmail.com","","Duke","Durham","North Carolina","United States","","","","","","Andrea","Miller","afroasianpoet@gmail.com","","Stanford","Stanford","California","United States","","","","","","Kumi","Hodge","khodge@stanford.edu","","Stanford","Stanford","California","United States","","","","","","Ariana","Mann","mann@mit.edu","","MIT","Cambridge","Massachusetts","United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Two studies investigated how computer interface affordances influence basic cognition, including ideational fluency, problem solving, and inferential reasoning. In one study comparing interfaces with different input capabilities, students expressed 56% more nonlinguistic representations (diagrams, symbols, numbers) when using pen interfaces. A linear regression confirmed that nonlinguistic communication directly mediated a substantial increase (38.5%) in students’ ability to produce appropriate science ideas. In contrast, students expressed 41% more linguistic content when using a keyboard-based interface, which mediated a drop in science ideation. A follow-up study pursued the question of how interfaces that prime nonlinguistic communication so effectively facilitate cognition. This study examined the relation between students’ expression of nonlinguistic representations and their inference accuracy when using analogous digital and non-digital pen tools. Perhaps surprisingly, the digital pen interface stimulated construction of more diagrams, more correct Venn diagrams, and more accurate domain inferences. Students’ construction of multiple diagrams to represent a problem also directly suppressed overgeneralization errors, the most common inference failure. These research results reveal that computer interfaces have communications affordances, which elicit communication patterns that can substantially stimulate or impede basic cognition. Implications are discussed for designing new digital tools for thinking, with an emphasis on nonlinguistic and especially spatial representations that are most poorly supported by current keyboard-based interfaces.

We explore the space of pointing models and describe how independent contributions of movement amplitude and target width to pointing time can be captured in a parameter k. Through a re-analysis of data from related work we demonstrate that one-part formulations are fragile in describing pointing performance, and that this fragility is present for various devices and techniques. We show that this same data can be significantly better described using two-part models. Finally, we demonstrate through further analysis of previous work and new experimental data that k increases linearly with gain. Our primary contribution is the demonstration that Fitts’s Law is more limited in applicability than previously appreciated, and that more robust models, such as Welford’s formulation, should be adopted in many cases of practical interest.","","TOCHI-2011-0061.R1","Nov 15 20:00"

This prospect would not only be a valuable evaluation indicator for game designers, but also for real-time personalization of the game experience. Psychology studies on acted touch behaviour show the existence of discriminative affective profiles. In this paper, finger-stroke features during gameplay on an iPod were extracted and their discriminative power analysed. Machine learning algorithms were used to build systems for automatically discriminating between four emotional states (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored), two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. Accuracy reached between 69% and 77% for the four emotional states, and higher results (~89%) were obtained for discriminating between two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. We conclude by discussing the factors relevant to the generalization of the results to applications other than games. ","user experience, games","TOCHI-2012-0021.R1","Nov 15 20:37"
"to103","","Embodied Cognition And The Magical Future Of Interaction Design","David","Kirsh","kirsh@ucsd.edu","no","","David Kirsh","David","Kirsh","kirsh@ucsd.edu","","UCSD","San Diego","California","United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The theory of embodied cognition can provide HCI practitioners and theorists with new ideas about interaction and new principles for design.  To support this claim I present four ideas: 1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive – tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; 2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains – we often use our bodies for cognitive ends, such as to model processes, and this modeling figures as a mediating structure in thinking and practicing; 3) we know more by doing than by seeing – there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; and 4) there are times when we literally think with things – our ability to think with our body and tools supports a process that enables us to think with arbitrary physical objects.  These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.","design","TOCHI-2011-0123.R1","Nov 15 21:01"

While prior work in HCI and visualization has proposed a variety of ways of presenting keyphrases, less attention has been paid to selecting the best descriptive terms. In this article, we investigate the statistical and linguistic properties of keyphrases chosen by human judges and determine which features are most predictive of high-quality descriptive phrases. Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges. Crowdsourced ratings of tag cloud visualizations rank our approach above other automatic techniques. Finally, we discuss the role of HCI methods in developing new algorithmic techniques suitable for user-facing applications.","","TOCHI-2011-0081.R1","Nov 16 03:52"

Research has shown that paper’s dominance can be attributed to the fact that it supports a broad range of these users’ diverse reading requirements. Our analysis of the literature suggests that a new class of reading device consisting of an interconnected environment of thin and lightweight electronic slates could potentially unify the distinct advantages of e-books, PCs, and tabletop computers to offer an electronic reading solution providing functionality comparable to, or even exceeding, that of paper. This article presents the design and construction of such a system. In it, we explain how \ data can be mapped to slates, detail interactions for linking the slates, and describe tools that leverage the connectivity between slates. A preliminary study of the system indicates that such a system has the potential of being an electronic alternative to paper.","","TOCHI-2011-0083.R1","Nov 16 05:04"

Nowadays, however, couples are often forced to live apart. Accordingly, there has been a growing and flourishing interest in designing technologies that mediate (and create) a feeling of relatedness when being separated – beyond the explicit verbal communication and simple emoticons available technologies offer. This paper provides a review of 143 published artifacts (i.e., design concepts, technologies). Based on this, we present six strategies used by designers/researchers to create a relatedness experience: Awareness, expressivity, physicalness, gift giving, joint action, and memories. We understand those strategies as starting points for the experience-oriented design of technology.","design, user experience","TOCHI-2011-124","Nov 16 05:20"

Evaluating such applications requires testing a large pool \ of participants to capture the diversity of experience, but traditional usability testing can be prohibitively \ expensive. To address this problem, this article contributes a new usability evaluation method called backtracking analysis, designed to automate the process of detecting and characterizing usability problems in creation-oriented applications. The key insight is that interaction breakdowns in creation-oriented applications often manifest themselves in backtracking operations that can be automatically logged (e.g., undo and erase operations). Backtracking analysis synchronizes these events to contextual data such as screen capture video, helping the evaluator to characterize speciﬁc usability problems. The results from three experiments demonstrate that backtracking events can be effective indicators of usability problems in creation-oriented applications, and can yield a cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory usability testing.","user experience","TOCHI-2011-0077.R1","Nov 16 11:16"

Because of its design orientation, human-computer interaction (HCI) education is an excellent venue for studio-based instruction. In an HCI course, we have been exploring a studio-based learning activity called the prototype walkthrough, in which a student project team simulates its evolving user interface prototype while a student audience member acts as a test user. The audience is encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback. We have observed that prototype walkthroughs create excellent conditions for learning about user interface design. In order to better understand the educational value of the activity, we performed a content analysis of a video corpus of 16 prototype walkthroughs held in two HCI courses. We found that the prototype walkthrough discussions were dominated by relevant design issues. Moreover, mirroring the justification behavior of the expert instructor, students justified over 80 percent of their design statements and critiques, with nearly one-quarter of those justifications having a theoretical or empirical basis. Our findings suggest that PWs provide valuable opportunities for students to actively learn HCI design by participating in authentic practice, and provide insight into how such opportunities can be best promoted.","","TOCHI-2012-0014","Nov 17 15:47"

The interface provided a setting for face-to-face shared narration and support for the management of disagreements. The interface allows for escalation and de-escalation of the conflict emerging in the shared narration and requires that participants perform joint actions when a contribution to the story is to be removed from the overall narration. A between-subjects experiment compared the tabletop interface and a desktop multimedia interface with mixed pairs (male Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian-Arab youth). The results demonstrated that the experience with the tabletop interface appears to be motivating and, most importantly, produces at least a short-term shift of attitude toward the other.","design, user experience","TOCHI-2011-0084","Nov 18 16:42"

Such data can be used to make the spaces tha t we inhabit responsive and interactive. Personal data in its different forms are one important data stream that such spaces are designed to respond to. In turn, one stream of personal data currently attracting high levels of interest in the HCI community is physiological data (e.g. heart rate, electro dermal activity), but this has seen little consideration in building architecture or the design of responsive environments. In this context, we developed a prototype mapping a single occupant’s respiration to its size and form, while it also sonifies their heart beat. The result is a breathing building prototype, formative trials of which suggested that it triggers behavioural and physiological adaptations in inhabitants without giving them instruction s and it is perceived as a relaxing experience. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a controlled study of this prototype, comparing three conditions: the static prototype, regular movement and sonification and a biofeedback condition, where the occupant’s physiological data directly drives the prototype and presents this data back to them. The study confirmed that the biofeedback condition does indeed trigger behavioural changes and changes in participants’physiology, resulting in lower respiration rates as well as higher respiration amplitudes, respiration to heart rate coherence and lower frequency heart rate variability. Self-reported state of relaxation is more dependent on inhabitant preferences, their knowledge of physiological data and whether they found space to ‘let go’. We conclude with a discussion of ExoBuilding as an immersive but also sharable biofeedback training interface and the wider potential of this approach to making buildings adapt to their inhabitants.","design, user experience, arts","TOCHI-2011-0078.R2","Nov 19 02:09"

These inference processes may also well operate when judgments about a product’s user-experience are made. To examine this, an inference model of user-experience, based on Hassenzahl and Monk’s [2010], was explored in three studies using Web sites. All studies supported the model’s predictions and its stability, with hands-on experience, different products, and different usage modes (action mode versus goal mode). Within a unified framework of judgment as inference [Kruglanski et al. 2007], our approach allows for the integration of the effects of a wide range of information sources on judgments of user-experience.

Polynomial-based Video-Oculography (VOG) systems are one of the most attractive gaze estimation methods thanks to their simplicity and ease of implementation. Although the functionality of these systems is generally acceptable, there has been no thorough comparative study to date of how themapping equations affect the final system response. After developing a taxonomic classification of calibration functions, we examined over 400,000 models and evaluated the validity of several conventional assumptions. Our rigorous experimental procedure enabled us to optimize the calibration process for a real VOG gaze-tracking system and halve the calibration time while avoiding a detrimental effect on the accuracy or tolerance to head movement. Finally, a geometry-based method is implemented and tested. The results and performance is compared with those obtained by the general purpose expressions.","engineering, user experience, health","TOCHI-2011-0079.R2","Nov 20 07:52"

Evaluations with three children showed that the prototype system, which automatically generates utterances, has the potential to support disabled individuals to participate better in interactive conversation. Analysis of a conversational transcript and observations indicate that the children were able to access relevant conversation and had more control in the conversation in comparison to their usual interactions where control lay mainly with the speaking partner.

We hypothesized that these effects are moderated by the technology’s utilitarian and hedonic values. The model was validated for smartphone functions. A user survey showed that perceived ease of use significantly affected the intention to continue using only for high-utilitarian functions, whereas pleasure affected the intention to continue using only for high-hedonic functions. The effect of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-utilitarian than for low-utilitarian functions. The effect of pleasure on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-hedonic than for low-hedonic functions.

Promising means to provide basic communication abilities to subjects affected by severe motor impairments are brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), i.e., systems that directly translate brain signals into device commands bypassing any muscle or nerve mediation. To date, the use of BCIs for effective verbal communication is yet an open issue - primarily due to the low rates of information transfer that can be achieved with this technology. Still, the performance of BCI spelling applications can be considerably improved by a smart user interface design and by the adoption of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text prediction.  The objective of this work is to suggest an approach and a user interface for BCI spelling applications combining state-of-the-art BCI and NLP techniques to maximize the overall communication rate of the system. The BCI paradigm adopted is motor imagery, i.e., when the subject imagines to move a certain part of the body, he/she produces modifications to specific brain rhythms that are detected in real-time through an electroencephalogram and translated into commands for a spelling application. By maximizing the overall communication rate our approach is twofold: on one hand we maximize the information transfer rate from the control signal, on the other side we optimize the way this information is employed for the purpose of verbal communication. The achieved results are satisfactory and comparable with the latest works reported in literature on motor-imagery BCI spellers. For the three subjects tested we obtained a spelling rate of respectively 3 char/min, 2.7 char/min and 2 char/min. ","health","TOCHI-2010-0077.R1","Nov 23 11:40"

The methodology was developed through a series of empirical projects, each focusing on different conceptions of movement available within motion-sensing interactive, immersive spaces. The methodology offers designers a set of principles, perspectives, methods and tools for exploring and testing movement-related design concepts. It is innovative for the inclusion of the perspective of the mover, together with the traditional perspectives of the observer and the machine. Making strange is put forward as an important tactic for rethinking how to approach the design of movement-based interaction.","design","TOCHI-2011-0107","Nov 23 23:17"

It also  provides a detailed analysis of two new related topics:, (1) Embodied Perception: the active and embodied nature of perception, including the body’s ability to extent its sensory apparatus through digital technology; and (2) Kinaesthetic Creativity: the body’s ability to relate in a direct and creative fashion with the “feel” dimension of interactive products during the design process.","design, user experience","TOCHI-2011-0118.R1","Nov 24 15:05"

This paper presents some findings on how mobile technology can be used to foster a better understanding of an archaeological site by reconstructing the ancient environment and life. Children aged 11-13 years old are the target of our research. To motivate and engage them, a pervasive educational game has been developed and implemented in Explore!, a system aimed at supporting children exploring sites of cultural interest. Special attention has been devoted to the design of a soundscape that may improve players’ navigation in degraded physical environments and enrich their overall experience. A field study indicated that children judged their experience both useful and entertaining: not only did they enjoy playing the game but they also learned historical notions and facts related to ancient Roman life. Contextual sounds were found to have a facilitating effect on space navigation, reducing the need for map reading and improving spatial orientation. This work provides insights into the design of educational games for use with cultural heritage and a model to enrich historical sites through the creation of soundscapes which can help visitors to navigate a site and feel its historical atmosphere.","design, cci","TOCHI-2010-0056.R3","Nov 26 11:47"

To determine the nature of teamwork errors, we conducted an observational study in a trauma center over a two-year period. While eventually successful in treating the patients, trauma teams had problems tracking \ and integrating information in a longitudinal trajectory, which resulted in inefficiencies and near-miss errors. As an initial step in system design to support trauma teams, we proposed a model of teamwork and a novel classification of team errors. Four types of team errors emerged from our analysis: communication errors, vigilance errors, interpretation errors, and management errors. Based on these findings, we identified key information structures to support team cognition and decision making. We believe that displaying these information structures will support distributed cognition of trauma teams. Our findings have broader applicability to other collaborative and dynamic work settings that are prone to human error.","design, health","TOCHI-2010-0047.R2","Nov 27 11:44"

We present research into the use of an adaptive persuasive technology, which introduces bursts of physical activity into a traditionally sedentary activity – computer game playing. Our game design approach leverages the playfulness and addictive nature of computer games to motivate players to engage in mild physical activity. The design allows players to gain virtual in-game rewards in return for performing real physical activity captured by sensory devices. This paper presents a two-stage analysis of the activity-motivating game design approach applied to a prototype game. Initially, we detail the overall acceptance of active games discovered when trialling the technology with 135 young players. Results showed that players performed more activity without negatively affecting their perceived enjoyment of the playing experience. The analysis did discover, however, a lack of balance between the amounts of physical activity carried out by players with various gaming skills, which prompted a subsequent investigation into adaptive techniques for balancing the amount of physical activity performed by players. An evaluation of additional 90 players showed that adaptive techniques successfully overcame the gaming skills dependence and achieved more balanced activity levels. Overall, this work positions activity-motivating games as an approach that can potentially change the way players interact with computer games and lead to healthier lifestyles.","health, games","TOCHI-2011-0006","Nov 27 17:36"

While the narrative of NUI serves a number of useful purposes, it also raises some concerns that make it increasingly important to examine the conceptual work being performed by this moniker and how these frame approaches to design and engineering in particular ways. Often the arguments made situate the locus of naturalness in the gestural interface alone, treating the issue as a representational concern. But in doing this, attention is perhaps less focused on the in situ and embodied aspects of interaction with such technologies. Drawing on examples of gestural interaction in the diverse settings of surgery and urban screen gaming, we consider naturalness as an occasioned property of action that social actors actively manage and produce together in situ through their interaction with each other and the material world.
